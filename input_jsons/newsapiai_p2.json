                            "body": "Amazon has officially begun building its broadband internet service in orbit with the delivery of the first batch of its Kuiper satellites.\n\nThe 27 satellites billionaire Jeff Bezos' company deployed April 28 following a rocket launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, are the first of thousands that will eventually comprise its new constellation. The venture would be a direct challenge to Elon Musk and SpaceX, the billionaire's spaceflight company that has spent six years building up its powerful Starlink satellite network for customers worldwide.\n\nThe launch even took place on the same night that SpaceX notched its 250th Starlink launch from Cape Canaveral.\n\nAmazon's $10 billion plans, known as Project Kuiper, will ultimately include more than 3,200 satellites in what's called low-Earth orbit - an altitude that allows for things like satellites to circle Earth fairly quickly.\n\nFloridians across the Cape and beyond gathered to watch the evening launch as the cargo was delivered atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\n\nHere's a recap of the launch, along with a look at some photos:\n\nThe Atlas V rocket from ULA - a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin - got off the ground right on time at 7:01 p.m. ET Monday, April 28, 2025.\n\nThe Atlas V was equipped with five solid rocket boosters for added liftoff power in addition to its main booster to accommodate the heaviest payload it's ever flown.\n\nFollowing liftoff, the rocket helped deploy the satellites at an altitude of 280 miles above Earth. The satellites then autonomously used their electric propulsion systems to ascend to 392 miles high, where they can orbit Earth once every 90 minutes, according to Amazon.\n\nBad weather scrubbed an initial launch attempt on April 9.\n\nThe mission, named \"KA-01\" for Kuiper Atlas 1, is just the first to deliver a batch of satellites as part of Amazon's Project Kuiper to provide high-speed internet to customers around the globe.\n\nThe satellites - Amazon's largest deployment to date - were significantly upgraded following an October 2023 launch of two prototype Kuiper satellites, according to the company.\n\nAmazon's Kuiper service seeks to rival SpaceX, which has long led the way in satellite launches, having launched more than 6,700 operational Starlink satellites into orbit since 2019.\n\nAmazon has touted the service as one that will benefit \"unserved and underserved communities\" in rural areas where internet access may be elusive.\n\nAmazon has already confirmed initial contact with all of the satellites from its mission operations center in Redmond, Washington.\n\n\"Initial deployment and activation sequences are proceeding nominally,\" Amazon said in a mission update. \"We'll have subsequent updates to share as the mission unfolds.\"\n\nThe launch is just the first of about 80 in the years ahead as Amazon continues to amass its satellite constellation in low-Earth orbit. If all goes as planned, the company said it expects to \"begin delivering service to customers later this year.\"\n\nThe United Launch Alliance, based in Colorado, will deploy a majority of the satellites on its Atlas V and Vulcan Centaur rockets. Amazon is also planning to contract with Arianespace and SpaceX as Blue Origin, which Bezos also owns, develops its massive New Glenn rocket for Kuiper deliveries.\n\nULA could launch up to five more Kuiper missions this year, ULA CEO Tory Bruno told Reuters in an interview this month. Amazon said in a 2020 FCC filing that it could begin service in some northern and southern regions at 578 satellites, with coverage expanding toward Earth's equator as the company launches more satellites.\n\nContributing: Rick Neale, Florida Today; Reuters\n\nEric Lagatta is the Space Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

                            "body": "Goodbye to wind power in the world -- Student 'hacks' maths formula and confirms century-old myth\n\nPerhaps the future of energy could be reshaped by a discovery buried 950 meters beneath the surface of the mountains of northern Albania. The hope for mankind comes in the form of a rather vast, naturally occurring reservoir of hydrogen gas. After being discovered in the Bulqizë chromite mine, this hydrogen source is considered to be the most significant in the world, which now holds the key to unlock a cleaner future.\n\nAccording to estimates, the mine releases approximately 220 tons of hydrogen yearly and the gas that comes from this mine is composed of 84% of hydrogen. The huge reservoir has the potential of containing about 55,000 tons of hydrogen underneath the surface. If the hydrogen amount beneath the surface is confirmed and thereafter extracted reasonably and responsibly, mankind's fuel needs will be sorted for approximately two centuries.\n\nThe great news is that hydrogen found in the mountains of northern Albania can be considered to be natural hydrogen, or rather, white hydrogen. This means that, as opposed to traditional hydrogen extraction processes that require energy-intensive processes powered by fossil fuels, white hydrogen forms naturally within Earth's crust. So safe is white hydrogen that even when burnt, it releases only water, causing it to be a zero-emission fuel and a rare gem in the fight against climate change.\n\nWhile gray hydrogen that is commonly produced from fossil fuels and green hydrogen produced from renewable energy are the most common hydrogen forms today, white hydrogen has many benefits. For one, white hydrogen costs just $1 per kilogram when it is harvested. This differs from green hydrogen that costs $6 when harvested per kilogram.\n\nWhite hydrogen is thus a far cleaner and much cheaper option. The advantages of white hydrogen are what make the discovery so noteworthy, as this type of hydrogen can surely compete with other forms of hydrogen.\n\nThe beauty of this discovery was that it was made in a rather rare geological environment, a Jurassic ophiolitic massif, part of the Earth's ancient oceanic crust that was thrust onto land by tectonic processes. Iron and magnesium-rich rocks tends to produce hydrogen when in close contact with water through a process called serpentinization.\n\nThe Bulqizë mine is unique due to certain geological faults that have caused larger volumes of hydrogen to form in underground reservoirs. The amount of hydrogen produced and stored surely is noteworthy. When geological features like the production of hydrogen are understood, researchers can work towards tapping into these rich hydrogen sources, such as hydrogen reservoirs. Pure hydrogen is great, but when hydrogen is fused with nitrogen, the results could be catastrophic.\n\nAlthough the Bulqizë hydrogen field offers plenty hydrogen, scientists suggests that caution should be exercised when trying to extract the natural hydrogen. This ecological environment is home to various biospheres and ecosystems, making any type of extraction a kind of environmental risk. Researchers emphasize the need for thorough studies before commercial exploitation can begin.\n\nThe process of harnessing and extracting natural hydrogen is relatively new. Investment is required to ensure that the same mistakes defined by the fossil fuel era are not repeated. Clean, abundant, and affordable energy are the order of the day. The rich wealth of hydrogen buried deep under Albian terrain could be a source of cleaner energy for future generations who will shift their focus solely to ecological living.\n\nResearchers advocating for this study suggest that a potential energy source has been uncovered with the possibility of offering a supply for hundreds of years or more. Finding a source of white hydrogen could prevent us from making the biggest mistake in history: turning hydrogen black.",

The state is also promoting rooftop solar installations and building a skilled workforce. Lucknow, Apr 29 (PTI) The Uttar Pradesh government is advancing policy-driven efforts to accelerate green revolution in the state and has signed initial agreements with the Smart Energy Council of Australia and the Hinduja Group.\n\nThe government has set an ambitious target to generate 500 gigawatts of solar energy by 2030, an official statement said.\n\nWith a vision to transform Uttar Pradesh, especially regions like Bundelkhand, Vindhya, and adjoining areas, into a hub for solar energy, the government is taking policy-driven efforts, it added.\n\n\"The state recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Smart Energy Council of Australia and the Hinduja Group in a significant move. The government has set an ambitious target to generate 500 gigawatts of solar energy by 2030,\" it said.\n\nThe government also noted that as solar capacity expands, so will local employment -- from panel manufacturing to installation, maintenance, grid integration, and transmission.\n\nThe government has launched the Solar Mitra Yojana to build a skilled workforce, it said.\n\nWhen Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath took office in 2017, the state's solar energy production was just 288 MW, it said, adding that \"Today, that figure has increased tenfold, and the growth is still ongoing. Under the Solar Energy Policy 2022, a near-term target of 2,200 MW has been set.\"\n\n\"To realize this vision, solar parks will be established across all municipal corporations, solar grids will be installed along expressways and railway tracks, and streetlights will be powered by solar energy. Transmission infrastructure will also be reinforced, with a special emphasis on Bundelkhand,\" the government said.\n\nAyodhya is being developed as a solar city and in a phased manner, the remaining 16 municipal corporations and Noida are also being transformed into solar cities, according to the statement.\n\n\"Key solar parks are planned in Jhansi, Jalaun, Chitrakoot, Lalitpur, Kanpur City, and Kanpur Dehat. Notably, the Bundelkhand Expressway is set to become India's first solar expressway, marking a milestone in sustainable infrastructure,\" it added.\n\nThe government is aggressively promoting rooftop solar installations under PM Surya Ghar Yojana to boost adoption. The target for rooftop panels in FY 2025-26 has been doubled to 2.65 lakh units, it added.",

                            "body": "Tony Blair has warned Western policies to tackle global climate change are \"failing\", demanding a radical reset to win over hearts and minds on the issue.\n\nThe major intervention by the former prime minister torpedoes current net zero policies and calls for the COP process to be torn down and replaced.\n\nIt is a shot across the bows of the current Labour government and energy secretary Ed Miliband's plans to push headlong towards renewables.\n\nWriting the foreword for his own think tank's new paper, The Climate Paradox: Why We Need to Reset Action on Climate Change, Sir Tony warned that there is a widening credibility gap with voters who are \"being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know that their impact on global emissions is minimal.\"\n\nThe intervention could not come at a more sensitive time for Sir Keir Starmer's government which is facing local elections in 48 hours, a first serious electoral test since the general election.\n\nSir Tony endorses the paper, authored by the Tony Blair Institute (TBI)'s director of climate and energy policy Lindy Fursman, which calls for the COP international series of conferences to be dismantled, while a \"new coalition\" must be built to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nIt claims that COP is struggling to \"deliver change at the speed required\" and must evolve to match ambition with delivery.\n\nIn his foreword, Sir Tony argues that while climate activism has succeeded in raising awareness, today's policy strategies have become disconnected from political, public, and economic reality, and the debate is \"riven with irrationality\". The result is a widening credibility gap between climate policy and climate delivery.\n\n\"Activists have shifted the political centre of gravity on climate,\" he said, but \"the movement now needs a public mandate - attainable only through a shift from protest to pragmatic policy.\"\n\nHighlighting a cycle that pushes proposals but delivers little real progress on global emissions, he wrote that \"political leaders by and large know that the debate has become irrational\" but are \"terrified of saying so, for fear of being accused of being 'climate deniers.'\"\n\nMeanwhile, voters \"feel they're being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know that their impact on global emissions is minimal.\"\n\nSir Tony pointed to global trends that undermine today's climate approach: fossil fuel use is set to rise further up to 2030, airline travel is to double over the next 20 years, and by 2030, almost two-thirds of emissions will come from China, India, and Southeast Asia.\n\nThese are \"inconvenient facts\" he says, that mean that \"any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging COP's role in scaling ambition, Sir Tony said that \"the process will not deliver change at the speed required\":\n\n\"The great gathering of all the nations has its place - though probably not every year. But the reality is it is the decisions of the large countries, and the policy direction they give towards the technology and the financial flows, which can in truth solve the climate issue.\"\n\nHe proposes a new model which must evolve to match ambition with delivery: \"We now need a new process that scales global solutions. A new cooperative approach to technological Instead of eliminating emissions with green energy and electric cars, the papers urges governments to prioritise global investment in carbon capture - investing in solutions that capture emissions at source before they reach the atmosphere, together with breakthrough technologies like direct air capture that permanently remove carbon.\n\nThe TBI also wants them to harness the power of technology, including AI - decarbonising smarter and faster, technology can turbocharge the path to net zero, from smarter tech delivering lower bills, to better systems and faster progress.\n\nIt argues that AI applied to energy efficiency and the better use of the energy grid is potentially revolutionary in reducing energy demand.\n\nThere is also a call to invest in frontier energy solutions - including new generation nuclear and fusion technologies. The papers argue that small modular reactors offer hope but need integration into energy strategy. Scaling up means less pollution, more jobs and new abundant energy sources that don't fuel the climate crisis.\n\nThe TBI also wants Starmer's government and others to scale up nature-based solutions - from planting forests to developing carbon-smart crops, we must harness the power of nature and science together. They argue that nature is one of our best allies in this fight, and we need to back it with smart science and innovation.",

Portugal and France were affected too. It is a developing situation at the time of writing, with many, many people without power and without access to critical services like transport, payment systems and internet. Not only is this an unprecedented blackout, it occurred right at the peak of Spain's solar power generation in the middle of the day: It has only been a few weeks since renewables in Spain hit a significant record level of output. The past few weeks have seen sustained high penetration levels of solar power generation in the country: It is still very unclear what caused it. The most we have so part is Portugal's grid operator blaming an 'atmospheric phenomenon' in Spain. Spain's grid operator hasn't said anything, at the time of writing. But that hasn't stopped a wide range of people doing exactly what we expect them to: blaming renewable energy.\n\nRenew Economy 29th April 2025 read more \"\n\nSpain is one of the countries at the forefront of efforts to rely more on renewable electricity as part of the shift away from fossil fuels, but Monday's crisis is likely to stoke concerns about power networks' ability to meet the added demand and increased volatility of supply from renewables. Elaborating on the possible cause of the blackout, Sánchez said: \"At 12:33 this morning, 15GW of generation were suddenly lost from the system and they were lost in just five seconds. This is something that has never happened before. 15GW is equivalent to approximately 60% of the country's demand at that time. Weather data showed that the temperatures over southern Spain had risen sharply between midday and 1pm local time. Higher temperatures can limit how much electricity cables can carry. However, Stephen Jarvis, an assistant professor in environmental economics at LSE, said the weather had not been abnormal and a system failure was the likelier culprit, as supply and demand became mismatched.\n\nFT 28th April 2025 read more \"\n\nLights flickered back to life across most of Spain and Portugal on Tuesday after a massive blackout hit the Iberian peninsula, stranding passengers in trains and elevators while millions lost phone and internet coverage. Electricity had been restored to nearly 90% of mainland Spain by early on Tuesday, the grid operator REE said. Power was restored overnight to around 6.2m households in Portugal out of 6.5m, according to the national electricity grid operator. Lights also came on again in Madrid and in Portugal's capital, Lisbon. Barely a corner of the peninsula, which has a joint population of almost 60 million people, escaped the blackout. But no firm cause for the shutdown has yet emerged.\n\nGuardian 28th April 2025 read more \"\n\nA reliance on net zero energy left Spain and Portugal vulnerable to the mass blackouts engulfing the region, experts said on Monday night. In what is believed to be Europe's largest power cut, tens of millions of people were left without electricity, while flights were grounded, trains halted and whole cities were left without power, internet access or other vital services. The cause of the initial fault in the region's electricity grid is still being investigated, and the EU has insisted that there were no indications that it was a cyberattack. However, energy experts have blamed a heavy reliance on solar and wind farms in Spain for leaving the region's power grid vulnerable to such a crisis.\n\nTelegraph 28th April 2025 read more \"\n\nWhat exactly caused the massive power cuts that swept Spain, Portugal and parts of southern France? That is the question on the lips of every energy expert in Europe - and theories abound. Spanish authorities suggested they were investigating the possibility of a cyber attack on grid infrastructure, while some officials in Portugal initially said it was caused by a freak weather phenomenon before backtracking. Both say the exact cause is still unknown. At the same time, others have warned that Spain's growing reliance on renewable energy, particularly solar power, may also have contributed to the crisis.\n\nThe operators of Spain's nuclear reactors are preparing to reconnect to the power grid as they recover their external electricity supply, the country's nuclear safety council said on Monday. The only exception is the Trillo plant, which is shut down for refueling, it said. The nuclear safety council had said earlier that the reactors were in safe condition after a power blackout hit the country. Four reactors stopped operating automatically after the outage, after which emergency generators kicked in.\n\nReuters 28th April 2025 read more \"\n\nA frantic search is on to figure out what, exactly, caused Spain and Portugal to lose power on Monday, leaving millions of people without access to basic modern necessities. The answer will have serious ramifications for the two countries -- and for Europe as a whole. The EU has been pressing the Iberian Peninsula, which has long operated as an energy island within the bloc, to link up better to Europe's grids. Already on Monday, specialists were debating whether such connections could have helped prevent the massive blackouts -- or put more countries at risk of experiencing spillover effects. Spain and Portugal are champions of green energy in the EU, and were sourcing over 80 percent of their electricity from renewables just before the outage hit on Monday. Experts have previously said that the rapid expansion of wind and solar power is putting increased pressure on the Spanish grid, which is in need of an upgrade to handle record volumes of intermittent renewables. But green energy was not to blame for Monday's blackout, Meeus said, since the EU has in recent years enforced several sets of rules, like updated grid connection codes from 2016, to prevent renewable power generators from disconnecting from the network in a way that endangers the system.\n\nPolitico 28th April 2025 read more \"\n\nSome analysts have suggested that the Spanish grid operator's reliance on renewable energy sources to supply the majority of the nation's electricity could have led to the blackout. Traditional generators, like coal and hydroelectric plants or gas turbines, are connected directly to the grid via heavy spinning machines. When turned on, these massive machines are in constant motion and the inertia created by their weight and momentum acts like a shock absorber, helping to insulate the grid against a sudden disturbance - for example, in the event of a transmission failure. Solar and wind power do not provide the natural inertia generated by these so-called 'spinning machines', leaving the grid more vulnerable to disruptions and subsequent oscillations in the electrical frequency.",

                            "body": "🎉 Celebrating 15 years with you, we're updating our look and feel! Please excuse any disruptions as we bring our site up to date for an even better experience.\n\nBy Damilola Ogunbiyi, CEO and Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All, and Co-Chair of UN-Energy\n\nEnergy access is a fundamental driver of economic growth. However, Africa faces a daunting challenge - approximately 600 million people continue to live in energy poverty, while one billion lack access to clean cooking solutions. At the same time, estimates place the Black population at 1% of the energy workforce. Projections indicate that Africa's energy demand will more than triple by 2040. This surge in demand, coupled with the current energy deficits, necessitates urgent interventions. The critical question for Africa and much of the developing world is how to provide more energy but lower emissions.\n\nSustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) is an international organization hosted by the United Nations Office for Project Service (UNOPS), with a global mandate to accelerate progress on the energy transition in emerging and developing countries. The organisation collaborates with governments and partners worldwide to end energy poverty, accelerate the deployment of renewable energy solutions, and combat climate change.\n\nThe SEforALL analysis, conducted in 2024, aims to understand the scale of the challenge and identify the urgency required to meet global energy targets. This analysis builds on the latest data from the Tracking SDG7: The Energy Progress Report 2024, providing a snapshot of the world's current situation across the four targets of SDG7: electricity access, clean cooking access, renewable energy, and energy efficiency.\n\nOur analysis shows that if we do not urgently raise ambition, the number of people in Africa without electricity access may stay the same by 2030. If we are to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) by 2030, we must provide electricity access to 157 million people per year and increase clean cooking access for 334 million people each year.\n\nHowever, despite the scale of action needed, there are examples of leadership that are already thriving on the continent. Countries such as Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda are on track for full electricity access by 2030, offering inspiration to other countries.\n\nGhana has invested significantly in renewable energy sources, particularly solar power. Kenya has focused on diversifying its energy mix with investments in geothermal, wind, and solar power. Rwanda is increasing energy access through innovative approaches and government commitment.\n\nAfrica's capacity for renewable energy potential is huge but remains unrealized. The continent holds 60% of the world's best solar resources yet accounts for just 1% of installed solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity. Currently, sub-Saharan Africa relies heavily on diesel and petrol generators, with customers spending nearly $20 billion annually on fuel alone. This reliance is costly and unsustainable.\n\nSeveral initiatives are underway to boost Africa's renewable energy resources, but it is critical that this be done in a way that creates opportunities for local communities, and general economic prosperity for countries. One of the most ambitious initiatives that is trying to boost the clean energy economy in Africa is Mission 300, spearheaded by the World Bank Group and the African Development Bank working together with SEforALL, the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), and The Rockefeller Foundation. This initiative aims to provide electricity access to 300 million people in Africa by 2030.\n\nBy utilizing Africa's abundant renewable resources, Mission 300 aims to create a sustainable and resilient energy infrastructure that can support economic growth and improve the quality of life for millions of people.\n\nOne of the key components of Mission 300 is the development and implementation of National Energy Compacts. These compacts outline bold commitments and the critical actions needed to advance energy access in a reliable, affordable, and sustainable manner. The initiative will be supported by innovative financing mechanisms, bringing public, private and philanthropic capital together to support the implementation of Mission 300.\n\nAfrica's demand for power is projected to grow eight-fold by 2050. Renewables are expected to meet much of this demand, creating a significant market opportunity for establishing local green manufacturing hubs. SEforALL forecasts that by 2030, up to 14 million energy transition jobs could be created in Africa. The energy transition could offer the means for bringing in equity in the global energy markets, a philosophy that we are guided by in our work on green industrialisation across developing countries.\n\nSEforALL is also a key partner of the Global Africa Business Initiative (GABI), which is playing a key role in advancing energy access and the energy transition across Africa. Annually, GABI's 'Unstoppable Africa' event in New York engages the world in conversations that truly matter, focusing on critical issues such as energy access and energy transition. GABI aims to bridge the gap between Africa's vast renewable energy potential and its current energy deficits by encouraging investment in renewable energy projects and supporting policies that facilitate the growth of this sector.\n\nBy encouraging investment in energy-transition technologies, GABI aims to create jobs, improve healthcare and education, enhance digital inclusivity, and boost overall economic productivity. Through these efforts, GABI is positioning Africa as a key player in the global energy landscape and paving the way for a more sustainable future.\n\nThe energy transition is already underway in Africa, but we must accelerate it. We know the scale of what needs to be done. We have the solutions. Now, we must act! This is Africa's moment to power its future -- sustainably, equitably, and at scale.",

                            "body": "While political and social momentum behind a major expansion of nuclear power builds there is nonetheless a rather large elephant in the room - where's the money? Nuclear power has long been characterised as a technology that can only be built at scale with the help of state backing. While that may not mean direct financing of construction, it is clear that even where reactor developments are privately funded they are underpinned by the state somewhere along the line, backed by tax-payer indemnified long-term power purchase agreements for example or extended preferential loan agreements.\n\nFor critics, this fact has long been employed as an ace to trump any prospective nuclear project no matter how attractive and desirable it may be. Indeed, it might be expected that the financing challenge emerges as the primary excuse to continue the fight against nuclear as the remaining technical issues, such as long-term high level waste management for example, are resolved and delivered. This argument of last resort is particularly galling as nuclear power plants are operating reliably and safely for longer and longer. The cost of electricity from a nuclear plant operating for 60, 80 or maybe ultimately even a century or more is dirt cheap when compared with, say, a wind farm that may only operate for 20 years and produces a miniscule fraction of the energy in comparison. Right now though, after the global pandemic, the 2008 financial crash and other pressing needs for limited resources, government coffers the world over are looking pretty spartan. That reality may be expected to curb the prospects for tripling nuclear capacity over the next few decades with the massive scales of investment that implies.\n\nThe picture may not be a gloomy as it first appears though. On the sidelines of the recent CERAWeek 2025 event in Houston, a cross-industry group of large energy users signed a pledge supporting the three times goal. Signatories to the agreement reads like a roster of the wealthiest corporate entities that have existed. Digital giants like Amazon, Google, Meta joined heavy industrials like Dow and Occidental in recognising the role of nuclear in helping achieve global goals for enhanced energy resiliency and security, and continuous firm clean energy supply. Indeed, the agreement explicitly emphasised that large energy users depend on the availability of abundant energy for their success and that nuclear energy can provide that energy round the clock, independently of the weather, the season or the location. Signatories further agreed that, perhaps uniquely, there is a significant role for nuclear across a wide range of economic activity, including the technology sector, increased electrification, the provision of high temperature industrial process heat, hydrogen production, district heating and the production of synthetic fuels. Of course, the agreement acknowledges the important role of governments in supporting nuclear investment, noting that by ensuring nuclear has equal access to finance, governments can enable nuclear capacity deployment at scale worldwide. The industrials and techies also applaude those governments which have signed the declaration to triple nuclear capacity and thank them for their commitment to mobilise nuclear investment alongise the development and construction of new nuclear reactors, including SMRs and advanced reactors.\n\nAs an aspirational agreement this latest declaration clearly isn't the whole solution to nuclear finance, but as a statement of intent it speaks volumes. The signatories represent a huge slice of long-term energy demand and a ready-made customer base ripe for nuclear deployment. It's a vital link in the value chain. In fact so vital that nuclear finance may yet turn out to be less of challenge than the industry has ever been given credit for.",

                            "body": "Winter Fuel Payments to be reinstated for all people over State Pension age in Scotland\n\nMore than 300,000 homes are at risk of losing their hot water and heating when their electricity meters are switched off on June 30, the industry has said. Energy companies have admitted that current rates of replacement mean it is likely that thousands of Radio Teleswitching System (RTS) meters will not have been upgraded before the technology is switched off.\n\nThe RTS system - used by older electricity meters to control heating and hot water - uses a longwave radio frequency to switch between peak and off-peak rates. However the technology is becoming obsolete and energy companies have a deadline to change their customers' meters by June 30.\n\nA spokesman for Energy UK, which represents energy firms, said that, at the end of March, 430,000 households remained on an RTS meter and more than 1,000 were being replaced each day.\n\nCampaigners said this implies that more than 300,000 households could be left with a meter which does not work from July 1, including 150,000 in Scotland.\n\nMost homes have standard meters and will not be affected, whether or not they have a smart meter.\n\nNed Hammond, Energy UK's deputy director for customers, told BBC Radio 4's You And Yours programme that the rate of replacement is rising, but added: \"Obviously we'd need to increase from there significantly still to replace all the meters by the end of June.\"\n\nAsked whether it is impossible to get every RTS meter switched over by June 30, he said: \"I wouldn't want to say impossible - but clearly very, very difficult to get to that point.\"\n\nIndustry regulator Ofgem has said the risks associated with not having a functioning meter include heating and hot water left continually on or off, electric storage heaters charging at the wrong time of day, possibly leading to higher bills, and the supplier being unable to confirm electricity usage during peak or off-peak times.\n\nThe End Fuel Poverty Coalition has written to the watchdog and the UK Government to raise concerns about the pace and communication of the meter replacement effort.\n\nThe coalition said the replacement programme is falling dangerously behind schedule, with energy suppliers unable to meet existing targets and thousands of customers - especially in rural Scotland - still without a plan for replacement.\n\nThe letter reads: \"Based on our members' conversations with energy suppliers, we estimate that, in Scotland alone, tens of thousands of RTS meters are yet to be addressed, leaving many consumers in limbo.\"\n\nSimon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said: \"Our member organisations across the country will continue to do all they can to support the transition and raise awareness of the switch, but urgent action is now required.\n\n\"There is a very real risk that over 300,000 households will find their RTS meter stops working properly come 1 July 2025.\n\n\"With pressures on the replacement programme growing and with limited engineer availability, especially in rural areas, there's a real risk of prolonged disruption, particularly for vulnerable households.\"\n\nThe campaigner continued: \"Government, regulators and energy firms need to face up to the looming crisis and ramp up efforts to help people switch.\n\n\"At the same time we now need to ensure contingency measures are in place for those who do not make the deadline and require energy suppliers to ensure fair metering and billing practices.\"\n\nA Smart Energy GB spokeswoman said: \"The RTS switch-off could result in households with Radio Teleswitch meters losing control of their heating and hot water. It is therefore crucial that anyone with an RTS meter accepts an upgrade from their supplier now.\n\n\"Most RTS meter replacements will be a smart meter, which can be programmed to deliver a similar service to RTS and offer the best option for the vast majority of homes and businesses.\n\n\"Smart meters provide accurate, automatic meter readings and give you greater visibility over your energy usage, helping you to manage your usage and save money. With a smart meter you'll also have access to a range of tariffs to suit your situation.\"\n\nAccording to Ofgem, you may have an RTS meter if:\n\nPeople are also being warned to be aware that if someone contacts you claiming you need to pay to change your meter because it is likely to be a scam.",

                            "body": "ESA's groundbreaking Biomass satellite, designed to provide unprecedented insights into the world's forests and their crucial role in Earth's carbon cycle, has been launched. The satellite lifted off aboard a Vega-C rocket from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, on 29 April at 11:15 CEST (06:15 local time).\n\nLess than an hour after launch, Biomass separated from the rocket's upper stage. At 12:27 CEST, the satellite controllers at ESA's European Space Operations Centre in Germany received the all-important first signal, relayed via the Troll ground station in Antarctica, that Biomass is working as expected in orbit.\n\nControllers will spend the coming days carrying out the 'launch and early orbit' phase, meticulously verifying that all systems are functioning correctly.\n\nThis critical phase also involves a series of intricate manoeuvres to deploy the satellite's 12-metre-wide mesh reflector supported by a 7.5-metre boom. Once this phase is complete, Biomass will join the portfolio of pioneering missions operated from ESA's mission control centre.\n\nCarrying the first P-band synthetic aperture radar in space, the Biomass mission is designed to deliver crucial information about the state of our forests and how they are changing, and to further our knowledge of the role forests play in the carbon cycle.\n\nESA's Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonetta Cheli, said, \"I'd like to extend my congratulations to everyone who has been involved in developing and launching this extraordinary mission. Biomass now joins our esteemed family of Earth Explorers - missions that have consistently delivered groundbreaking discoveries and advanced scientific understanding of our planet.\n\n\"With Biomass, we are poised to gain vital new data on how much carbon is stored in the world's forests, helping to fill key gaps in our knowledge of the carbon cycle and, ultimately, Earth's climate system.\"\n\nForests play a vital role in Earth's carbon cycle by absorbing and storing large amounts of carbon dioxide, helping to regulate the planet's temperature. Often called 'Earth's green lungs', they absorb around 8 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. However, deforestation and degradation - especially in tropical regions - are releasing stored carbon back into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.\n\nA major challenge for scientists and policymakers is the lack of accurate data on how much carbon forests store and how these stocks are changing owing to factors such as rising temperatures, increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and human-driven land-use changes.\n\nBiomass is the first satellite equipped with a P-band synthetic aperture radar, which is capable of penetrating forest canopies to measure woody biomass - trunks, branches, and stems - where most forest carbon is stored. These measurements act as a proxy for carbon storage, the assessment of which is the mission's primary goal.\n\nData from Biomass will significantly reduce uncertainties in carbon stock and flux estimates, including those related to land-use change, forest loss, and regrowth.\n\nAbout Biomass\n\nESA's Biomass forest mission uses advanced space technology to provide new data on forests and their changes. It enhances our understanding of forests' roles in the carbon cycle and climate. Its P-band radar penetrates clouds and forest layers, scattering signals off forest elements. These signals reveal details like forest biomass and height. Biomass data will improve knowledge of habitat loss and its effects on biodiversity. The mission also enables the mapping of subsurface geology in deserts, ice sheet structures, and forest floor topography.\n\nThe satellite was developed by over 50 companies led by Airbus UK.\n\nAbout Vega-C\n\nEurope's Vega-C rocket can launch up to 3300 kg into space, including small scientific and Earth observation satellites. At 35 m tall, Vega-C weighs 210 tonnes on the launch pad and reaches orbit with three solid-propellant-powered stages before the fourth liquid-propellant stage takes over for precise placement of satellites into their desired orbit around Earth. Vega-C is the evolution of the Vega family of rockets and delivers increased performance, greater payload volume and improved competitiveness\n\nhttps://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Videos/2025/04/Lifting_the_canopy_on_Earth_s_forests",

                            "body": "The Herd Road bridge that crosses Richards Creek will be closed for approximately four months as North Cowichan carries out major upgrades on the structure.\n\nNorth Cowichan's council approved the $1.7-million project at its meeting on April 16, and the work is expected to commence later this year.\n\nThe bridge, which connects the communities of Crofton and Maple Bay to the Trans-Canada Highway, is on Herd Road, which is a major arterial road carrying more than 2,500 vehicles per day east and 2,500 vehicles west.\n\nThe concrete 37-year old bridge is deteriorating, putting the structural integrity of the girders that support the bridge deck at risk.\n\nIn addition, some other structural components, such as the pile cap and piles that support the bridge girders, need minor repairs.\n\nJohn Dehoop, North Cowichan's manager of infrastructure, said in a staff report that the deterioration of the bridge has been caused by the application of road salt in the winter months, which, while necessary, can compromise the integrity of the structure's concrete deck.\n\nHe said that this will eventually lead to undermining the girders supporting the bridge deck.\n\n\"If salt-laden water is able to make its way through the bridge deck and migrate into the underlying structural components, the bridge structure itself may be damaged,\" Dehoop said.\n\n\"This type of deterioration is typical for bridges of this age on Vancouver Island, and the proposed work is considered normal based on the age of this structure. Based on an assessment from 2024, if the upgrades and minor repairs are not done, more extensive and costly repairs will be necessary. Such work would also require the bridge to be closed for a longer duration.\"\n\nThe project will address the deficiencies with the bridge deck and the underlying structure, as well as the bridge barriers that don't currently meet the latest design standards.\n\nDehoop said the bridge work is being coordinated with the Bell McKinnon Road/Herd Road roundabout construction project to reduce inconvenience to the public as much as possible.\n\nSeismic 2000 Construction Ltd.was awarded the contract with its bid of $1.7 million, which is well below the original estimate of $2.4 million for the bridge work.\n\nCoun. Mike Caljouw asked if 37 years is the normal lifespan for a bridge like the one on Herd Road.\n\nClay Reitsma, North Cowichan's director of engineering, said a bridge of this type typically has a lifespan of about 50 years before it has to be replaced.\n\n\"We're at year 37 and it's typical to have to do these kinds of repairs midstream so that we can extend the life of the bridge and get the 50 years out of it,\" he said.\n\nCoun. Bruce Findlay asked Reitsma what would the cost be if the bridge had to be entirely replaced.\n\n\"Don't quote me on this, but based on some of the estimates we have on other bridges, we're thinking about $7 million to $10 million,\" Reitsma said.\n\n\"It's really tough right now to predict these prices and, as each year goes by, I'm continually shocked by the increase in infrastructure costs.\"",

                            "body": "Thousands of deaths per year in the UK may be linked to the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs), analysis suggests.\n\nExperts behind the research said they believe there is a relationship between people eating UPFs and an increased risk of early death.\n\nUPFs have been linked previously to poor health, including to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease, cancer and early death.\n\nExamples of UPFs include ice cream, processed meats, crisps, mass-produced bread, some breakfast cereals, biscuits and fizzy drinks.\n\nUPFs often contain high levels of saturated fat, salt, sugar and additives, which experts say leaves less room in people's diets for more nutritious foods.\n\nREAD MORE: Man jailed after exposing himself on busy high street\n\nUPFs also tend to include additives and ingredients that are not used when people cook from scratch, such as preservatives, emulsifiers and artificial colours and flavours.\n\nNerys Astbury, associate professor from the University of Oxford, said it is known that consuming diets higher in calories, fat and sugar can have detrimental effects on health, including premature mortality.\n\n\"This study adds to the body of evidence on the association between UPF and ill health and disease,\" Dr Astbury added.\n\n\"However, many UPF tend to be high in these nutrients, and studies to date have been unable to determine with certainty whether the effects of UPF are independent of the already established effects of diets high in foods which are energy dense and contain large amounts of fat and sugar.\n\n\"The authors of the study conclude that advice to reduce UPF consumption should be included in national dietary guideline recommendations and in public policies.\n\n\"However, rushing to add recommendations on UPF to these recommendations is not warranted based on this study in my opinion.\"\n\nShe said the Nova system, which defines foods according to different levels of food processing, \"has many limitations, including arbitrary definitions and overly broad food categories...\".\n\nShe added: \"More research is needed to ascertain a causal link between UPF and disease and to establish the mechanisms involved.\"\n\nSome experts say it is not clear why UPFs are linked to poor health and question whether this is because of processing or because people are opting for foods high in fat, sugar and salt rather than more nutritious options.\n\nIn the new study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, experts call on governments to issue dietary recommendations aimed at cutting consumption of UPFs.\n\nThey looked at data from eight countries around the world and found UPFs reached 53 per cent of people's energy intake in the UK - the second highest in the study after 55 per cent in the US.\n\nPremature deaths attributable to UPFs ranged from 4 per cent of premature deaths in lower consumption settings, such as Colombia, up to 14 per cent of premature deaths in the UK and US, according to their mathematical modelling.\n\nThe researchers suggested that in 2018/19, some 17,781 premature deaths in the UK could have been linked to UPFs, according to their model.\n\nStock image of fish and chips (Image: Getty) Lead investigator of the study Eduardo Nilson, from the scientific body the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Brazil, said: \"UPFs affect health beyond the individual impact of high content of critical nutrients (sodium, trans fats, and sugar) because of the changes in the foods during industrial processing and the use of artificial ingredients, including colourants, artificial flavours and sweeteners, emulsifiers, and many other additives and processing aids, so assessing deaths from all causes associated with UPF consumption allows an overall estimate of the effect of industrial food processing on health.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Jeremy Clarkson finds 'true calling' after jumping into action on farm\n\nDr Nilson said the study found \"each 10 per cent increase in the participation of UPFs in the diet increases the risk of death from all causes by three per cent\".\n\nStephen Burgess, statistician in the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge, said the study was observational and could not prove cause.\n\n\"This type of research cannot prove that consumption of ultra-processed foods is harmful, but it does provide evidence linking consumption with poorer health outcomes,\" he said.\n\n\"It is possible that the true causal risk factor is not ultra-processed foods, but a related risk factor such as better physical fitness - and ultra-processed foods is simply an innocent bystander.\n\n\"But when we see these associations replicated across many countries and cultures, it raises suspicion that ultra-processed foods may be more than a bystander.\"",

Portuguese grid operator REN said Tuesday morning all of the 89 power substations were back online since late last night and power had been restored to all 6.4 million customers.\n\nBy Tuesday morning, life was returning to normal: schools and offices reopened in Spain, traffic eased along the capital's main arteries and public transport restarted after significant delays.\n\nSpanish authorities did not provide new explanations for what caused the blackout, one of the most serious to ever take place in Europe.\n\nIn a televised address Monday night, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the power grid for the Southern European nation of 49 million people lost 15 gigawatts -- equivalent to 60% of its national demand -- in just five seconds.\n\n\"We have never had a complete collapse of the system,\" Sánchez said. Authorities were still investigating what happened on Tuesday.\n\nSuch widespread electric failure has little precedent on the Iberian Peninsula or in Europe.\n\nOn Tuesday, Spain's meteorological agency AEMET said that it had not detected any \"unusual meteorological or atmospheric phenomena\" on Monday, and no sudden temperature fluctuations were recorded at their weather stations.\n\nPortugal's National Cybersecurity Center on Monday threw cold water on feverish speculation about foul play, saying there was no sign that the outage resulted from a cyber attack. European Council President Antonio Costa also said there were \"no indications of any cyber attack\" Monday afternoon.\n\nTeresa Ribera, an executive vice president of the European Commission, also ruled out sabotage. Nonetheless, the outage \"is one of the most serious episodes recorded in Europe in recent times,\" she said.\n\nAt Spain's largest train stations, droves of travelers waited Tuesday morning to board trains, or to rebook tickets for journeys that were canceled or disrupted on Monday and return home.\n\nAt Atocha station in Madrid, hundreds of people stood near screens waiting for updates. Many had spent the night at the station, wrapped in blankets provided by the Red Cross around 1 a.m. Tuesday morning for those who had to wait overnight thanks to canceled trains. Similar scenes played out at Barcelona's Sants station.\n\nThe Madrid Open tennis tournament being held this week was still affected by the power outage Tuesday after its cancellation the previous day. Tournament organizers delayed opening its doors.\n\nMetro systems restored but other trains still disrupted\n\nBy 11 a.m. Tuesday, service on Madrid's metro system was fully restored. In Barcelona, the system was operating normally but commuter trains were suspended due to \"electrical instability,\" the company that runs the service, Rodalies Catalunya, said on X.\n\nIn some parts of the country, commuter and mid-distance services were still suspended or running at reduced capacity.\n\nEmergency workers in Spain said they had rescued some 35,000 passengers on Monday stranded along railways and underground, with the blackout turning sports centers, train stations and airports into makeshift overnight refuges.\n\nOn Monday, Rubén Carión was stranded on a commuter train outside Madrid, when he pried the window open and walked to the nearest transit station by foot. Then, he spent the night in the city's Atocha station after his train back to Barcelona was canceled.\n\nThe 24-year-old said he chose to wait overnight at the station instead of a hotel so he could stay updated on when he could board a train home, describing his experience as \"pure chaos.\"",

                            "body": "Despite tariff-related challenges, analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin's future, forecasting significant growth in the global hashrate by July 2025.\n\nAccording to the latest Cambridge survey, the US has firmly established itself as the world's largest Bitcoin (BTC) mining hub, accounting for 75.4% of the reported hashrate.\n\nThis comes as the country continues to prioritize the comprehensive development of the Bitcoin mining industry.\n\nThe findings from Cambridge were outlined in the recent Cambridge Digital Mining Industry Report. The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) conducted the survey between June and September 2024.\n\nOf 97 companies that registered for the survey, 49 completed it, resulting in a response rate of 50.5%. The report highlighted that the US significantly outpaced all other countries regarding Bitcoin mining dominance.\n\n\"Survey results further indicate that the US has solidified its position as the largest global mining hub (75.4% of reported activity),\" the report read.\n\nCanada came in second, at 7.1%. Paraguay, Norway, and Kazakhstan followed with 3.4%, 2.8%, and 2.6%, respectively. However, due to the US-dominated sample of respondents, the survey's findings may not fully reflect the global distribution of Bitcoin mining.\n\nAs a result, Cambridge acknowledged that the data may overrepresent US activity in Bitcoin mining and underrepresent activity in other countries. In fact, the latest data from the Hashrate Index showed that the US only accounts for 36.0% of the global hashrate.\n\nStill, the figure underlines the US' dominance in the industry, a position the country is looking to expand further. Recently, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick shared the nation's vision to boost the mining industry.\n\nLutnick highlighted the Commerce Department's investment accelerator initiative as a key resource to help miners gain greater autonomy over their energy needs. On March 31, President Trump signed an executive order establishing the \"United States Investment Accelerator.\"\n\nThe initiative seeks to streamline regulatory processes and facilitate investments above $1 billion. In a recent interview, Lutnick explained the investment accelerator's benefits for miners.\n\n\"We're going to make it if you want to mine Bitcoin and you find the right place to do it. You can build your own power plant next to it,\" he stated.\n\nSecretary Lutnick envisions that this could help Bitcoin mining companies become more independent from traditional energy grids. A notable aspect of this vision is using waste gas from gas fields to power mining operations.\n\nThis could lower energy costs and reduce environmental impact. By controlling their energy supply, miners would have the flexibility to manage costs more effectively, potentially boosting Bitcoin mining in America.\n\n\"The next generation of miners in America will be able to control their destiny, control the cost of power, and I think that is going to turbocharge uh Bitcoin mining in America,\" Lutnick added.\n\nAs Lutnick's vision materializes, companies are already positioning themselves to capitalize on the favorable conditions. Cleanspark, a Bitcoin mining company, is nearing approval for a new facility in Tennessee. This project is expected to strengthen the US mining sector, capitalizing on favorable regulations and access to energy resources.\n\nInterestingly, the sector has also attracted attention from high-profile figures, such as Eric and Donald Trump Jr. Last month, the President's son's partnered with Hut 8 to launch American Bitcoin Corp.\n\nThis new venture focuses on large-scale Bitcoin mining and building a strategic reserve. The firm has also outlined its ambition to go public in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, this rapid scaling of mining operations could significantly impact the global hashrate, which has already shown rapid growth in Q4 2024.\n\n\"The Bitcoin mining industry has largely shrugged off halving-related concerns, with network hashrate accelerating sharply in Q4 2024. This surge was driven by a combination of favourable political developments and a strong price rally, propelling the hashrate to a record high of 900 Eh/s,\" the CoinShares report noted.\n\nNotably, market analysts at CoinShares project that the global Bitcoin hashrate could surpass 1 zettahash per second (ZH/s) by July 2025. Moreover, by 2027, the number is expected to increase to 2 ZH/s.\n\nNonetheless, concerns remain. Tariffs on Southeast Asian countries, where most mining equipment is sourced from, increase costs.\n\nThis could lead to higher operational expenses, threatening profitability and US market dominance. Given this, CoinShares' analysts also project that Q1 and Q2 2025 results may be less favorable.\n\n\"Q1 results could disappoint as hash price continued its decline due to Bitcoin trading in a narrow range between US$80,000 and US$90,000. Q2 results may show deterioration, as tariffs on imported mining rigs range from 24% (Malaysia) to 54% (China). Miners relying on older or less efficient rigs face higher exposure to these tariffs,\" they remarked.\n\nDespite the challenges, analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin's future. It is gaining traction as a reserve asset among several US states. Furthermore, inflation and currency devaluation could strengthen Bitcoin's role as a hedge against economic uncertainty.",

To achieve peace through strength, Treasury will continue to take all available measures to deprive Iran's access to resources necessary to advance its missile programme.\"\n\nThe April 29 move targeted five China-based companies, one Iran-based firm and six Iran-based people. The Treasury accused the network of facilitating the procurement of sodium perchlorate and dioctyl sebacate from China to Iran.\n\nIt said sodium perchlorate is used to produce ammonium perchlorate, which alongside dioctyl sebacate is usable in solid propellant rocket motors, which Treasury said is commonly used for ballistic missiles.\n\nThe April 29 move is the latest action targeting Tehran since Mr Trump restored his \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Iran, which includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero to help prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon.\n\nIn his first 2017-2021 term, Mr Trump withdrew the US from a 2015 deal between Iran and world powers that placed strict limits on Tehran's uranium enrichment activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Mr Trump also reimposed sweeping US sanctions.\n\nSince then, Iran has far surpassed that deal's limits on uranium enrichment.\n\nWestern powers accuse Iran of having a clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons capability by enriching uranium to a high level of fissile purity, above what they say is justifiable for a civilian atomic energy programme.\n\nTehran says its nuclear programme is wholly for civilian power purposes.

                            "body": "The EU promised a renewable energy future - but is it still on track? As political shifts, policy delays and legal battles unfold, the energy transition faces new hurdles. Are we still moving forward, or is Europe starting to backpedal? Seden Anlar reports.\n\nOnce upon a time - 2019, to be exact - the European Green Deal was the golden child of EU policy. Politicians across the spectrum embraced it with enthusiasm, promising a continent powered by renewables and free from climate-wrecking emissions by 2050. Fast forward five years and that green glow has started to fade. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 threw energy markets into chaos, exposing the bloc's dependence on fossil fuels. The subsequent scramble for energy security did accelerate some aspects of the energy transition, but it also shifted the EU's focus toward immediate economic and defence concerns. Then came the political earthquake of 2024: an unprecedented surge of far-right and conservative parties swept into power, many of them itching to tear up environmental regulations in favour of 'competitiveness' and 'deregulation'.\n\nThis shifting political landscape has already translated into action. The EU recently delayed its landmark Deforestation Regulation following industry pushback, while the far-right European Conservatives and Reformists and the newly formed Patriots for Europe group have signalled their intent to weaken or dismantle key elements of the European Green Deal. With growing political opposition, the future of Europe's clean energy transition is increasingly uncertain. Is it still on track - or are these headwinds beginning to slow it down?\n\nDespite this political pushback, the EU's energy transition is still advancing - at least on paper. In 2024, nearly half of the bloc's electricity came from renewables, a dramatic leap from just 34% in 2019. This isn't just progress - it's a structural shift. Use of fossil fuels is crumbling. Coal, once the backbone of Europe's power system, has plummeted to less than 10% of the electricity mix - its lowest share in decades. And in a symbolic turning point, solar energy overtook coal for the first time ever.\n\nWind, meanwhile, held its position as the second-largest energy source after nuclear, continuing to outpace fossil gas. That's significant. Europe's gas-powered electricity production has been shrinking for five straight years, despite rising energy demand and an increase in EU power exports. Even as the bloc has had to send more electricity across borders - to energy-strapped countries like Ukraine and the UK - fossil fuel reliance has continued to decline. However, while the EU as a whole has made impressive strides - with wind and solar now generating nearly half of the bloc's electricity and coal on life support - at the national level, the pace of progress is wildly uneven.\n\nThe EU's energy transition isn't just an abstract political debate - it's playing out in real time across its Member States. Some countries are embracing the energy transition with open arms, pushing ambitious policies and accelerating their shift toward renewables. Others? They're treating it like an inconvenient chore - dragging their feet, delaying commitments or quietly lowering their targets when no one is looking.\n\nTo understand these differences, one can look at National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) - the blueprint for achieving the European Green Deal. Each Member State is legally required to submit one, outlining how they plan to ramp up renewables, cut emissions and improve energy efficiency. A strong NECP signals real commitment, backed by clear policies and investments. A weak or missing NECP is a flashing red warning sign that a country is stalling or backpedalling on climate policy. And right now, those warning signs are everywhere - some countries are pushing ahead, while others are falling behind or not even showing up.\n\nSome Member States aren't just meeting EU targets - they're surpassing them. Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands have made notable progress in scaling up wind and solar, setting ambitious targets that, in some cases, go beyond what the EU requires.\n\nSpain, for example, has pledged a renewable energy contribution that exceeds EU targets by 10 percentage points. The country has significantly expanded its solar and wind capacity in recent years, reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and increasing domestic electricity generation. Denmark, a country with a long-standing focus on renewables, is projected to overachieve its national targets. The country has continued to expand its wind energy sector, which already plays a key role in its electricity mix.\n\nThe Netherlands, despite previously lagging behind in the energy transition, has increased efforts to develop offshore wind projects and phase out coal power. While challenges remain, such as grid congestion and the need for further infrastructure investments, recent policy developments indicate an effort to accelerate the shift away from fossil fuels.\n\nBut not everyone is moving in the right direction. For instance, France (a self-proclaimed climate leader) and Sweden (a long-time renewables frontrunner) are quietly falling short. Their latest NECPs expose gaps in renewable targets, raising doubts about their ability to meet EU climate goals.\n\nFrance's updated NECP includes a renewable energy contribution that is 10 percentage points lower than what is required under EU law - one of the largest deficits among Member States. For a country that likes to present itself as a climate leader, this is a glaring contradiction. France's government has long prioritised its nuclear industry over renewables, and while nuclear is a low-carbon energy source, its reluctance to rapidly scale up wind and solar is now putting it out of step with EU-wide efforts.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising underperformer is Sweden. Unlike France, Sweden isn't just missing its renewable target - it hasn't even provided one in its latest NECP. For a country that has historically been seen as a climate leader, its lack of a clear commitment to expanding wind and solar in the updated plan has been noted as a significant omission. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess whether Sweden is on track to meet its long-term climate objectives.\n\nThe challenges with NECPs extend beyond weak commitments - some countries have struggled to submit them on time. Despite a legally binding deadline of 30 June 2024, by mid-October 2024, only 11 out of 27 EU Member States had submitted their final updated plans. In November 2024, the European Commission urged the remaining EU Member States to submit their overdue NECPs, emphasising the importance of timely and complete submissions. While the number of submitted plans increased to 22 out of 27 by February 2025, several countries still missed the deadline or provided incomplete plans.\n\nIf governments are delaying or deprioritising these plans, it raises broader questions about whether the EU's current governance framework is effectively ensuring compliance with its climate goals - or if national political shifts are starting to undermine collective progress.\n\nThe lack of ambition in several NECPs has not gone unnoticed. A coalition of environmental NGOs has taken legal action against France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden, arguing that their weak or incomplete plans violate EU climate laws. Their case is built on multiple shortcomings: these plans not only fall short of legally binding renewable energy targets, but they also lack transparency on fossil fuel subsidies - a critical accountability measure that ensures governments disclose financial support for high-emission industries. Additionally, the NGOs argue that these Member States have failed to involve the public in the decision-making process, despite public consultation being a key requirement under the EU's governance framework.\n\nMeanwhile, energy analysts have raised similar concerns, warning that governments are not keeping pace with market developments. The energy think tank Ember Energy has been particularly direct, saying that '[r]enewable energy markets have moved forward, but governments have not'. The private sector is already investing in wind and solar at record levels, with new capacity additions continuing to grow across the EU.\n\nHowever, without strong policies at the Member State level, infrastructure upgrades and grid expansions, this momentum may not be enough to keep the EU on track for its 2030 and 2050 climate targets. Many governments have yet to align their policy frameworks with the pace of private sector investments, leading to growing concerns that bottlenecks in permitting, financing and grid modernisation could slow down the energy transition just as it needs to accelerate.\n\nAt this point, the EU's energy transition stands at a crossroads. The numbers tell one story - record highs for renewables, record lows for fossil fuels - but the political reality is more complex. The transition is happening, but its pace depends on whether governments push forward or let momentum stall.\n\nFor renewables to continue expanding, governments must go beyond market forces. Strengthening NECPs is a crucial first step, ensuring they align with legally binding EU climate targets rather than being watered down or delayed. But policy alone isn't enough - governments must also balance economic, environmental and social concerns.\n\nWhether Europe stays on track or backpedals depends on the political choices made today. The technology is ready, and the market is moving - but without clear leadership, public investment and an inclusive approach, progress could stall.\n\nThe next few years will be critical. Will the European Commission enforce compliance? Will civil society pressure governments to raise ambition? Or will political forces opposed to the Green Deal succeed in stalling progress?\n\nWhat's clear is this: renewables aren't slowing down - but climate politics might be.",

                            "body": "US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un meet at Panmunjom on June 30, 2019. (Reuters/Yonhap)\n\nThe Trump administration in the US is reportedly laying the groundwork for a potential summit with North Korea, with the Swedish ambassador to Pyongyang recently visiting Washington to discuss that possibility.\n\n\"The Trump administration has quietly been holding discussions and consulting outside experts as it considers options for potentially restarting dialogue with North Korea,\" US news website Axios reported on Sunday, quoting a senior US official.\n\nAxios reported that while North Korea is \"relatively low on Trump's priority list\" and dialogue is probably not imminent, \"Trump has made clear he'd like to reconnect with Kim -- perhaps face-to-face -- and his national security team is preparing for that scenario.\"\n\n\"We are convening agencies to understand where the North Koreans are today. A lot has changed in the last four years. We are evaluating, diagnosing and talking about potential avenues, including engagement,\" the senior official told Axios.\n\nA former well-placed official in the US government said that Trump administration officials were doing some \"initial planning\" in the awareness that \"one flowery letter\" from Kim Jong-un could prompt Trump to head straight for dialogue.\n\n\"The Swedish ambassador to North Korea, who represents US interests in the country, visited Washington last week for consultations with US officials and experts. One source familiar with the visit said it was mostly about taking the temperature in Washington on engagement with Pyongyang,\" Axios reported.\n\n\"Officials from the State Department and National Security Council have also taken part in multiple roundtable discussions with outside experts on North Korea. One of the topics raised in those closed-door meetings was who the North Korean interlocutors are likely to be if talks do start,\" Axios said.\n\nMost of the North Korean officials who were involved with the Trump-Kim summits have been purged or are undergoing reeducation.\n\n\"The North Koreans don't seem to have named a new special envoy for US diplomacy,\" said Jenny Town, the director of the Korea program at the Stimson Center. \"Their position has been less negative about the prospects for negotiations lately, although they haven't said anything positive either.\"\n\n\"The regime's willingness to engage would depend on the nature of the conversation,\" Axios said, citing the former senior US official.\n\nSince North Korea's status as a nuclear power state is now explicitly endorsed by the country's constitution, Kim Jong-un is reportedly uninterested in discussing denuclearization, which was the topic of past talks.\n\nBut the former official said that if the agenda were about arms control and recognizing North Korea as a nuclear weapons state, \"they'll have those talks all day.\"\n\n\"Trump will also find it hard to generate the kind of leverage he had over Kim the first time around given North Korea's nuclear advances and stronger diplomatic position,\" Axios said.\n\n\"Chinese pressure on Pyongyang played a crucial role in Trump 1.0, but Beijing has made clear it's not interested in squeezing Kim again on Trump's behalf,\" Axios said, while noting that Pyongyang has \"deepened ties\" with Moscow by deploying troops to the war against Ukraine.\n\nAxios quoted the senior US official as saying that \"we are in a much worse situation today.\" That official blamed North Korea's nuclear advancement on the Biden administration.",

                            "body": "Transportation is the lifeblood of modern society, enabling the movement of people, goods, and ideas, which fuels economic growth, societal progress, and individual well-being. Its benefits are multifaceted, spanning economic prosperity, social connectivity, personal freedom, and access to essential services.\n\nTransportation's impact is far-reaching, shaping our lives in profound ways that are often taken for granted. Consider these core benefits:\n\nThe efficient movement of goods is paramount to a thriving economy. Effective supply chains, facilitated by robust transportation networks, allow businesses to access raw materials, manufacture products, and distribute them to consumers worldwide. This fosters competition, reduces prices, and expands market opportunities. Without reliable transportation, global trade would grind to a halt, crippling economies and limiting access to essential goods.\n\nTransportation connects people across geographical boundaries, fostering social interaction and cultural exchange. Whether it's commuting to work, visiting family and friends, or traveling for leisure, transportation allows us to build relationships, broaden our horizons, and experience different cultures. This promotes understanding, tolerance, and a more interconnected world.\n\nAccess to transportation provides individuals with increased freedom and independence. The ability to travel freely allows people to pursue educational opportunities, seek employment in diverse locations, access healthcare services, and participate in recreational activities. This empowerment contributes to a higher quality of life and greater personal fulfillment.\n\nTransportation is crucial for accessing essential services such as healthcare, education, and employment. In many communities, particularly in rural areas, reliable transportation is the only means of accessing these vital resources. Without it, individuals may be deprived of opportunities to improve their lives and contribute to society.\n\nTo further explore the significant benefits of transportation, let's address some frequently asked questions:\n\nTransportation infrastructure projects create numerous jobs directly and indirectly. From construction workers and engineers to truck drivers and logistics professionals, the transportation sector supports a vast network of employment opportunities. Furthermore, improved transportation facilitates economic growth, which in turn generates even more jobs across various industries. Investment in transportation infrastructure is therefore a powerful engine for job creation.\n\nWhile transportation provides significant benefits, it also poses environmental challenges, including air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and noise pollution. The burning of fossil fuels in vehicles contributes significantly to climate change and respiratory problems. Efforts to mitigate these challenges include developing cleaner transportation technologies, promoting public transportation, and encouraging sustainable urban planning.\n\nPublic transportation offers numerous advantages in urban areas, including reduced traffic congestion, improved air quality, and increased accessibility. By providing an alternative to private vehicles, public transportation helps to alleviate traffic jams, reduce emissions, and make cities more livable. It also provides affordable transportation options for low-income residents, improving their access to employment and other opportunities.\n\nAreas with good transportation infrastructure tend to have higher property values. Accessibility to major roads, public transportation, and airports increases the attractiveness of a location, making it more desirable for residents and businesses. This increased demand drives up property values and contributes to economic development.\n\nTechnology is transforming the transportation sector, improving efficiency and safety. Smart traffic management systems, GPS navigation, and autonomous vehicles are just a few examples of how technology is being used to optimize traffic flow, reduce accidents, and improve fuel efficiency. These advancements have the potential to revolutionize transportation and make it more sustainable.\n\nTransportation plays a crucial role in emergency response and disaster relief. During natural disasters or other emergencies, efficient transportation is essential for delivering aid, evacuating people, and providing medical care. Well-maintained roads, bridges, and airports are vital for ensuring a swift and effective response to emergencies.\n\nProviding transportation in rural areas presents unique challenges, including low population density, limited funding, and long distances. As a result, rural communities often lack access to reliable transportation options, which can hinder economic development and limit access to essential services. Innovative solutions, such as ride-sharing programs and demand-responsive transportation, are needed to address these challenges.\n\nTransportation is essential for tourism and recreation. Airports, highways, and public transportation systems enable people to travel to tourist destinations, explore new places, and participate in recreational activities. The tourism industry relies heavily on transportation, and improvements in transportation infrastructure can lead to increased tourism and economic benefits for local communities.\n\nEfficient transportation is vital for global trade and supply chains. Reliable transportation networks allow businesses to move goods across borders, access raw materials, and distribute finished products to consumers worldwide. Disruptions to transportation, such as port congestion or border delays, can have significant impacts on global trade and the economy.\n\nMaking transportation more sustainable requires a multifaceted approach, including investing in renewable energy sources, promoting public transportation, encouraging walking and cycling, and developing more fuel-efficient vehicles. Sustainable transportation solutions aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and minimize the environmental impact of transportation.\n\nTransportation policies have a significant impact on urban development. Investments in public transportation can encourage denser, more walkable urban environments, while investments in highways can lead to suburban sprawl. Transportation policies should be carefully considered to promote sustainable, equitable, and livable urban areas.\n\nThe future of transportation is likely to be shaped by several key trends, including autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, shared mobility services, and drone delivery. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize transportation, making it more efficient, sustainable, and accessible. However, careful planning and regulation will be needed to ensure that these technologies are deployed safely and equitably.\n\nTransportation is not merely a means of getting from point A to point B; it is a fundamental enabler of progress, connecting people, markets, and ideas. Understanding the multifaceted benefits of transportation is crucial for making informed decisions about transportation infrastructure, policies, and investments. By prioritizing sustainable and equitable transportation solutions, we can ensure that transportation continues to contribute to economic prosperity, social well-being, and a higher quality of life for all. Investing in a robust and adaptable transportation system is an investment in our collective future.",

                            "body": "The first was that he would successfully conclude diplomatic deals in the Ukrainian-Russian war and in Iran. The second was that he wouldn't mind expanding American territory. Neither claim is entirely new, but elements of each were made with greater clarity than before.\n\nAfter saying that he believes that peace is possible in Ukraine with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky both as presidents, but that success was contingent upon Trump being the president negotiating the deal, Trump was asked specifically about two difficult questions in the negotiations: NATO membership for Ukraine and territorial agreements.\n\nTrump said two things about NATO. Crucially for the negotiations, when asked if Ukraine should \"give up any hope of ever joining NATO,\" he said, \"I don't think they'll ever be able to join NATO.\" Three days earlier, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellog told Ukrainian, French, British and German officials that \"NATO isn't on the table.\" Trump's answer to the Time's interviewers is a clear statement of that American position in negotiations. The one-page peace plan that the U.S. presented to Ukraine in Paris on April 17 as the United State's \"final offer\" firmly states that \"Ukraine will not seek to join NATO.\"\n\nThe second thing Trump said about NATO was that \"what caused the war to start was when they started talking about joining NATO.\" Talk of the war being provoked and Russia having legitimate security concerns has been heresy in the West. But it is a point that has been conceded by both Ukraine and NATO.\n\nDavid Arakhamia, who led the Ukrainian negotiating team in the Belarus and Istanbul talks, confirmed that an assurance that Ukraine would not join NATO was the \"key point\" for Russia. According to Arakhamia, \"They were prepared to end the war if we agreed to, as Finland once did, neutrality, and committed that we would not join NATO.\" Zelensky, himself, said that the promise not to join NATO \"was the first fundamental point for the Russian Federation\" and that \"as far as I remember, they started a war because of this.\"\n\nJens Stoltenberg, who was then the Secretary General of NATO, said that a NATO promise of no further enlargement \"was a precondition\" for Russia \"not [to] invade Ukraine.\" Putin, Stoltenberg said, \"went to war to prevent NATO, more NATO, close to his borders.\"\n\nMoving from NATO to a territorial settlement, Time asked Trump if Russia should get to keep Crimea. Trump answered flatly that \"Crimea will stay with Russia.\" According to \"a source close to [Trump's special envoy Steve] Witkoff,\" \"The deal on the table is that the Russian-occupied territory is going to remain occupied. Russia's not pulling it out of it. That part is set in stone.\" The U.S. peace plan sets out that Washington will officially recognize \"Russian control of Crimea\" and de facto recognize territory in the Donbas currently occupied by Russia as under \"Russian control.\" Trump's Time statement seems to confirm a settled American position on Crimea.\n\nAs with Ukraine, Trump expressed optimism about successfully negotiating a nuclear agreement with Iran. However, he maintained the military threat.",

Navy blue wave 1 of 3 is now underway.\n\nThe NIKKEI 225 daily chart indicates a bullish trend is forming through an impulsive Elliott Wave structure. After completing the gray wave 2 correction, the index has entered navy blue wave 1 within the larger gray wave 3 setup. This position suggests the early movement of a fresh impulse, which could drive significant upward momentum in the coming sessions.\n\nNavy blue wave 1 marks the starting point of this new impulsive advance. Usually, this phase features building momentum as the market gains direction. The end of gray wave 2 sets a clear stage for wave 1, typically showing steady but not yet aggressive price moves. Current developments imply that the market will continue rising gradually before meeting the next correction.\n\nA key level to watch is 30,726. If the price falls below this point, the current bullish wave count would be invalid, and a reevaluation would be needed. This level serves as crucial support, safeguarding the low of wave 2.\n\nThe daily chart offers a broad view of the new wave structure. The present impulse wave shows potential for establishing further upward momentum. Traders should look for typical wave signs like increasing volume and a stable uptrend. However, it is normal for wave 1 to move slower compared to the stronger momentum expected in wave 3.\n\nThe next step to expect is the development of navy blue wave 2 after the completion of wave 1. This upcoming correction should offer a pullback opportunity before a stronger rally in wave 3 begins. Watching price action closely along with momentum indicators will help confirm the wave progress and spot the transition into wave 2.\n\nTechnical signals and price movements will be vital in verifying the unfolding wave structure. Moving into gray wave 3 at a higher degree hints at more powerful momentum ahead. This early stage is key for setting up positions and preparing for further upward growth.\n\nThe NIKKEI 225 weekly chart shows a strong bullish trend building through an impulsive Elliott Wave pattern. After completing the gray wave 2 correction, the index has moved into gray wave 3 within the larger orange wave 3 structure. This move marks entry into the most powerful phase of the trend, typically showing extended price growth and strong momentum.\n\nGray wave 3 usually signals the core trend segment in Elliott patterns, often bringing the sharpest price increases. Completing wave 2's correction clears the path for this major advance. Wave 3 often surpasses the reach of wave 1. Current readings suggest the market will likely continue upward strongly before meeting the next corrective move.\n\nThe weekly chart offers critical insight into the broader structure. Current action suggests a major bullish phase is developing. Moving into orange wave 3 at a higher degree indicates an even larger upward sequence may be forming over a longer timeframe.\n\nA key level to monitor is 30,726. If the market breaks below this level, the current bullish interpretation would be invalid, requiring a new wave analysis.\n\nTraders should watch wave 3's growth for classic signs such as strong momentum, rising volume, and smooth upward progression. Analysis recommends maintaining bullish exposure during this impulsive phase but staying alert for signals of wave 3 nearing completion.\n\nThe next expected movement is gray wave 4 after gray wave 3 completes. This correction should offer a good pullback chance before any further extension of the bullish trend.\n\nThis current phase typically provides the best conditions for trading within Elliott Wave progressions.",

Image data: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS Image processing: Jackie Branc (CC BY)\n\nNew data from the agency's Jovian orbiter sheds light on the fierce winds and cyclones of the gas giant's northern reaches and volcanic action on its fiery moon.\n\nNASA's Juno mission has gathered new findings after peering below Jupiter's cloud-covered atmosphere and the surface of its fiery moon, Io. Not only has the data helped develop a new model to better understand the fast-moving jet stream that encircles Jupiter's cyclone-festooned north pole, it's also revealed for the first time the subsurface temperature profile of Io, providing insights into the moon's inner structure and volcanic activity.\n\nTeam members presented the findings during a news briefing in Vienna on Tuesday, April 29, at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly.\n\n\"Everything about Jupiter is extreme. The planet is home to gigantic polar cyclones bigger than Australia, fierce jet streams, the most volcanic body in our solar system, the most powerful aurora, and the harshest radiation belts,\" said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of Juno at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"As Juno's orbit takes us to new regions of Jupiter's complex system, we're getting a closer look at the immensity of energy this gas giant wields.\"\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nMade with data from the JIRAM instrument aboard NASA's Juno, this animation shows the south polar region of Jupiter's moon Io during a Dec. 27, 2024, flyby. The bright spots are locations with higher temperatures caused by volcanic activity; the gray areas resulted when Io left the field of view. NASA/JPL/SwRI/ASI - JIRAM Team (A.M.) Lunar Radiator\n\nWhile Juno's microwave radiometer (MWR) was designed to peer beneath Jupiter's cloud tops, the team has also trained the instrument on Io, combining its data with Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) data for deeper insights.\n\n\"The Juno science team loves to combine very different datasets from very different instruments and see what we can learn,\" said Shannon Brown, a Juno scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"When we incorporated the MWR data with JIRAM's infrared imagery, we were surprised by what we saw: evidence of still-warm magma that hasn't yet solidified below Io's cooled crust. At every latitude and longitude, there were cooling lava flows.\"\n\nThe data suggests that about 10% of the moon's surface has these remnants of slowly cooling lava just below the surface. The result may help provide insight into how the moon renews its surface so quickly as well as how as well as how heat moves from its deep interior to the surface.\n\n\"Io's volcanos, lava fields, and subterranean lava flows act like a car radiator,\" said Brown, \"efficiently moving heat from the interior to the surface, cooling itself down in the vacuum of space.\"\n\nLooking at JIRAM data alone, the team also determined that the most energetic eruption in Io's history (first identified by the infrared imager during Juno's Dec. 27, 2024, Io flyby) was still spewing lava and ash as recently as March 2. Juno mission scientists believe it remains active today and expect more observations on May 6, when the solar-powered spacecraft flies by the fiery moon at a distance of about 55,300 miles (89,000 kilometers).\n\nThis composite image, derived from data collected in 2017 by the JIRAM instrument aboard NASA's Juno, shows the central cyclone at Jupiter's north pole and the eight cy-clones that encircle it. Data from the mission indicates these storms are enduring fea-tures.NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/ASI/INAF/JIRAM Colder Climes\n\nOn its 53rd orbit (Feb 18, 2023), Juno began radio occultation experiments to explore the gas giant's atmospheric temperature structure. With this technique, a radio signal is transmitted from Earth to Juno and back, passing through Jupiter's atmosphere on both legs of the journey. As the planet's atmospheric layers bend the radio waves, scientists can precisely measure the effects of this refraction to derive detailed information about the temperature and density of the atmosphere.\n\nSo far, Juno has completed 26 radio occultation soundings. Among the most compelling discoveries: the first-ever temperature measurement of Jupiter's north polar stratospheric cap reveals the region is about 11 degrees Celsius cooler than its surroundings and is encircled by winds exceeding 100 mph (161 kph).\n\nPolar Cyclones\n\nThe team's recent findings also focus on the cyclones that haunt Jupiter's north. Years of data from the JunoCam visible light imager and JIRAM have allowed Juno scientists to observe the long-term movement of Jupiter's massive northern polar cyclone and the eight cyclones that encircle it. Unlike hurricanes on Earth, which typically occur in isolation and at lower latitudes, Jupiter's are confined to the polar region.\n\nBy tracking the cyclones' movements across multiple orbits, the scientists observed that each storm gradually drifts toward the pole due to a process called \"beta drift\" (the interaction between the Coriolis force and the cyclone's circular wind pattern). This is similar to how hurricanes on our planet migrate, but Earthly cyclones break up before reaching the pole due to the lack of warm, moist air needed to fuel them, as well as the weakening of the Coriolis force near the poles. What's more, Jupiter's cyclones cluster together while approaching the pole, and their motion slows as they begin interacting with neighboring cyclones.\n\n\"These competing forces result in the cyclones 'bouncing' off one another in a manner reminiscent of springs in a mechanical system,\" said Yohai Kaspi, a Juno co-investigator from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. \"This interaction not only stabilizes the entire configuration, but also causes the cyclones to oscillate around their central positions, as they slowly drift westward, clockwise, around the pole.\"\n\nThe new atmospheric model helps explain the motion of cyclones not only on Jupiter, but potentially on other planets, including Earth.\n\n\"One of the great things about Juno is its orbit is ever-changing, which means we get a new vantage point each time as we perform a science flyby,\" said Bolton. \"In the extended mission, that means we're continuing to go where no spacecraft has gone before, including spending more time in the strongest planetary radiation belts in the solar system. It's a little scary, but we've built Juno like a tank and are learning more about this intense environment each time we go through it.\"\n\nMore About Juno\n\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, California, manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Scott Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. Juno is part of NASA's New Frontiers Program, which is managed at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for the agency's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The Italian Space Agency funded the Jovian InfraRed Auroral Mapper. Lockheed Martin Space in Denver built and operates the spacecraft. Various other institutions around the U.S. provided several of the other scientific instruments on Juno.\n\n/Public Release.

The move allows the central government to coordinate the response, including mobilizing the military.\n\nSanchez added that Spain would declare a state of emergency in any other region that ask for it, something Murcia in the country's southeast later requested, according to Spanish broadcaster RTVE.\n\nElectricity went out across Spain and Portugal around midday and is being gradually restored. Many areas in Spain have endured nearly nine hours without power.\n\nWhile Sanchez said the security situation remained positive, much of Spain's transport system ground to a halt. Metros and trains stopped service, while major cities experienced traffic gridlock after traffic lights failed.\n\nThousands of people also had to be rescued from elevators, with around 150 such incidents reported in Madrid alone, according to the capital city's mayor.\n\nSanchez urged citizens to stay calm, conserve phone batteries, and avoid speculation or spreading misinformation about the causes of the blackout.\n\nTrain stations are remaining open overnight to allow stranded passengers to stay.\n\nAccording to Spanish daily El Pais, this is the worst power outage in Spanish history.\n\nThe blackout also caused widespread disruption in Portugal, whose prime minister said the issue originated from a problem in the Spanish system.",

                            "body": "Amid 25% hike in power bills, Pakistanis rush to adopt solar energy as a cost-saving alternative.\n\nAmid the sweltering 40-degree heat that gripped Karachi in April, entrepreneur Saad Saleem ran his air-conditioning without hesitation.\n\nDespite a sharp rise in electricity tariffs, Saleem remained unaffected, having earlier invested $7,500 to install solar panels on the roof of his bungalow -- part of a broader solar energy boom taking place across Pakistan.\n\nSaleem bought his modules two years ago, as the International Monetary Fund and economically beleaguered Pakistan were hammering out a preliminary bailout program. Under the deal, Pakistan sharply raised power and gas tariffs to support struggling suppliers in the heavily indebted sector.\n\nPakistanis now pay more than a quarter more on average for electricity, setting off a scramble to install solar modules.\n\nSolar made up over 14 percent of Pakistan's power supply last year, up from 4 percent in 2021 and displacing coal as the third-largest energy source, according to UK energy think-tank Ember. That is nearly double the share in China, the world's top supplier of solar panels and a global leader in green technologies, and one of the highest rates in Asia, according to Reuters' analysis of Ember data.\n\nBut the explosion in solar uptake has left out many in Pakistan's struggling urban middle class, who have been forced to cut back on electricity in face of soaring bills, according to interviews with more than two dozen people, including energy officials, consumers and power-sector analysts. Most of the nation's solar panels aren't connected to sell excess capacity to the grid, so the benefits of cheap and reliable power aren't widely shared.\n\nThe flight of affluent Pakistanis with solar access from the national grid has dealt a further blow to those relying on pricey conventional sources of power. Electricity companies that lost their most lucrative clients have been forced to additionally hike prices on their shrinking pool of customers to cover operating costs, according to Arzachel, a Karachi-based energy consultancy.\n\nSome observers also blame financial stress in the energy sector on deals Pakistan made with China for Beijing to finance billions of dollars' worth of power-generation contracts, many of which involve coal-fired plants. Pakistan is behind on many of the payments and has been in talks with China about extending the time it has to repay the debt.\n\nCountries like South Africa also face widening energy gaps after affluent residents adopted solar power. But analysts are watching Pakistan particularly closely due to the pace at which the nation of 250 million has taken to sun-based energy.\n\n\"This could serve as a cautionary tale as to how regulation and policy needs to keep up with technological change and rapidly evolving economics,\" said Haneea Isaad, an Islamabad-based energy finance specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Pakistan power minister Awais Leghari acknowledged the energy gap but noted that tariffs have come down significantly since June 2024, when the IMF approved reductions.\n\nHe also pointed to heavy uptake of solar by rural Pakistanis, many of whom previously had limited access to the grid. Many non-urban Pakistanis have installed small solar setups to meet their power needs, which are typically far lower than those of their city-dwelling counterparts.\n\n\"Pakistan has actually gone through a solar revolution,\" he said. \"The grid is going to get cleaner by the day, and this is something that we've achieved as a nation that we are proud of.\"\n\nJust a few miles away from Saleem's upscale neighborhood, Nadia Khan has restructured her life to cut electricity costs.\n\nThe air-conditioning in the homemaker's apartment is rarely used and she's stopped ironing most of the clothes worn by her family of five, citing the price of power.\n\nKhan's family is not alone in cutting back: Only 1 percent of paying consumers used over 400 units of power in 2024, per Karachi-based consultancy Renewables First, down from 10 percent before the pandemic.\n\nLike others among Pakistan's masses of apartment dwellers without space to install solar modules, Khan has been shut out of the revolution.\n\nThe roofs of many apartment buildings are designated for water storage and other sanitation purposes, while owners of rental buildings have little incentive to invest in solar connections for their tenants.\n\n\"We get some sunlight indoors but I can't seem to think of a way to go solar,\" she said. \"Why must people living in apartments suffer?\"\n\nMeanwhile, land-owning Pakistanis have benefited from the glut of Chinese-made low-cost solar modules shut out of the West by high tariffs.\n\nChina exported 16.6 gigawatts of solar capacity to Pakistan last year, according to Ember, about five times as much as in 2022. The average cost per watt of solar-module capacity exported also fell 54 percent in the same period.\n\nHowever, most solar setups aren't configured to send spare power back to the grid, limiting their benefit to the wider public. Renewables expert Syed Faizan Ali Shah, who advises the government on solar adoption, has said that less than 10 percent of solar consumers sell excess power to the grid.\n\nExperts and government officials blame high costs and sanctioning delays. Connecting a solar module to the grid usually takes between three and nine months, said Renewables First energy expert Ahtasam Ahmad, prompting many to not bother.\n\nConverting power generated from a solar panel for transmission to the grid also requires equipment like inverters, which typically cost between $1,400 and $1,800, or roughly half the median household income in Pakistan.\n\nSUNK COSTS\n\nPakistan conglomerate Interloop has installed hundreds of solar modules next to its cowsheds in Punjab province that help provide the electricity keeping its 9,300 livestock cool and their milk chilled.\n\nThe investment in solar has been a lucrative one for Interloop, which typically breaks even on solar installation costs after three to four years. Basic operating costs are about three quarters less than payments to the grid, said Interloop energy manager Faizan Ul Haq.\n\nThe money Interloop saves also reflects a gaping hole in the accounts of Pakistan's power companies.\n\nEven though industrial groups and wealthier Pakistanis now consume less grid power, suppliers' costs haven't changed proportionately. Fixed expenses like fuel contracts and upgrades to transmission architecture accounted for about 70 percent of supplier expenditure in the year to June 2024, according to an Arzachel estimate.\n\nTo cover costs, suppliers have raised prices on their remaining customers, who have already faced repeated increases as a result of the IMF deal.\n\nFixed costs of 200 billion rupees were shifted to non-solar consumers in the 2023-2024 fiscal year, meaning they paid 6.3 percent more per kilowatt-hour than they otherwise would have, according to Arzachel data.\n\nSolar panel imports have increased since, meaning grid demand is likely to continue dropping, forcing remaining customers to pay more.\n\n\"Pakistan's experience demonstrates a crucial lesson: when governments fail to adapt quickly enough, people take charge,\" said Ahmad of Renewables First.",

                            "title": "The F-35 Has a Message for New Boeing F-47 6th-Generation Fighter",
                            "body": "Defense giant Lockheed Martin is proposing a new F-35 Lightning II fighter jet variant. The yet-unnamed fighter would combine some of the capabilities of the upcoming F-47 fighter jet with the already successful F-35 platform.\n\nHow this proposed \"new\" fighter would fit in with existing air forces, including the US Air Force, remains to be seen.\n\nIn March 2025, the United States Air Force announced defense contractor Boeing had won the Next Generation Air Dominance fighter contract. Boeing beat Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman to develop and manufacture the new fighter, designated F-47. The F-47 will be the first new fighter for Boeing in decades. Competitor Lockheed Martin dropped from the three-way race by the Air Force for not meeting program requirements, has said it will not contest the decision.\n\nInstead, Lockheed Martin announced the company will develop a \"fifth-generation plus\" version of the F-35, which incorporates technology designed for future versions of the F-35 and NGAD into the existing airframe. According to Breaking Defense, Lockheed CEO Jim Taiclet told the press during a quarterly earnings call, \"We're basically going to take the [F-35] chassis and turn it into a Ferrari,\" Taiclet said. \"It's like a NASCAR upgrade, so to speak, where we would take the F-35 [and] apply some of those co-funded technologies both from NGAD and the F-35 program.\"\n\nAccording to Taiclet, the goal is to develop a version of the F-35 that has eighty percent of the capability of the F-47 but at just fifty percent of the price. Lockheed Martin reportedly tested and flew a prototype NGAD aircraft before it was disqualified.\n\nThe CEO stated that there were \"materials,\" \"geometries,\" \"countermeasures for stealth,\" and new weapons and tracking systems. Taiclet also said his engineers were sure his vision of an F-35 on steroids was doable.\n\nThe F-35 is an evolving program, with decades of upgrades already planned for the worldwide fleet of fighters. The latest upgrade, Block 4, will be paired with a computer hardware and software upgrade, Tech Refresh 3, without which many new capabilities won't be possible. Block 4, which is finally hitting air forces worldwide, includes \"over 75 major upgrades\" for all three F-35 versions, including updates to the jet's electronic warfare system, sensor upgrades, the ability to carry new and more weapons, advanced networking capabilities, and an unknown number of classified capabilities. The features set for Block 4 have been in place for several years now, likely before Lockheed Martin's NGAD prototype took flight, leaving open the possibility that new technologies that aren't in Block 4 made it to NGAD.\n\nThis \"new\" aircraft -- we'll call it F-35D for now -- would likely feature ninety percent internal changes. The F-35's stealthiness is in large part due to its shape. Taiclet himself implied there would be little to no changes in the outward design when he stated the company would take the F-35 chassis \"and turn it into a Ferrari.\" Even minor changes could have major implications for the aircraft's radar signature, making it detectable by radar at greater distances.\n\nIn other words, almost all new technology would have to fit under the aircraft's skin. The F-35 is already jam-packed so that most new tech would displace existing equipment. In most cases, that would probably be an improvement of existing capabilities. A new laser weapon might replace the 25mm GAU-22/A Gatling gun system built into the -A model's fuselage and carried in an external pod on the -B and -C versions. It might even mean downgrading or eliminating existing capabilities to make room for new ones, with the Gatling gun swapped entirely for something else.\n\nAll of this leads to the question: how does the F-35D fit into the US Air Force and other allied air forces' fighter plans? After Block 4, the worldwide F-35 fleet will eventually be fitted out with Block 5, which will further update the fighter, and probably a Block 6.\n\nThis variant will include plenty of opportunities to introduce NGAD tech into the fleet, and the F-35 will mature into a \"fifth-generation-plus\" fighter on its own. This suggests that the F-35D will chart a different course, one that emphasizes air-to-air over the current criteria to perform both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. An example of an F-35D might be based on the -C model, with its additional range and increased fuel capacity via a podded fuel tank, replacing the podded gun.\n\nThe F-35D appears positioned as a spoiler aircraft that could be offered as an alternative to the F-47 if the new fighter encounters delays and cost overruns. If that were the case, Lockheed Martin could offer to step in and build the F-35D. Boeing took a similar tack with the F-15EX Eagle II, a new version of the half-century-old F-15 with many modern sensors, avionics, and weapons on par with the F-35. The F-15EX was introduced in a period of prolonged turmoil for the F-35 program.\n\nWhile it was not a direct replacement as a \"new\" aircraft with a proven record, it received favorable attention. The Air Force plans to buy between 98 and 144 F-15EXs, a decision that surprised defense watchers and no doubt sapped F-35 procurement. If the UK-Italy-Japan Global Combat Air Programme, or GCAP for short, fails to produce an airplane, the F-35D could be an alternative for all three countries, especially since they all already fly the F-35.\n\nThere's no guarantee that a F-35D would rack up orders, especially as the Navy and the Air Force concentrate on their own NGAD programs. As for exports, the Made in USA brand is taking a serious hit overseas as the Trump Administration bashes allies and tarnishes America's reputation as a stable partner.\n\nHowever, there seems to be little downside for Lockheed Martin to take the risk, especially since between the two NGAD programs and the F-35, there are unlikely to be new American fighters until at least the 2050s.\n\nThis is a period of political change unprecedented in the postwar period, and while it might not be a place for the F-35D now, at the rate the world is changing, there might be in five years.",

                            "title": "How high in demand are pilots?",
                            "body": "Pilot demand is exceptionally high globally, driven by a confluence of factors including airline expansion, an aging pilot workforce approaching retirement, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This shortage is not merely a future prediction; it's a current reality impacting flight operations, scheduling, and even the potential for future airline growth.\n\nThe aviation industry is grappling with a significant pilot shortage, projected to persist for several years. This isn't simply a cyclical issue; it's a deeply rooted problem stemming from various demographic and economic pressures. Airlines are actively competing for qualified pilots, offering increasingly attractive packages to attract and retain talent. The demand isn't limited to commercial airlines; it extends to cargo operators, business aviation, and even helicopter services. Understanding the root causes of this demand is crucial to grasping the overall landscape.\n\nSeveral factors have coalesced to create this perfect storm of pilot demand:\n\nVarious industry sources provide data on the projected pilot shortage. Boeing's Pilot and Technician Outlook, for example, consistently forecasts a significant demand for new pilots over the next two decades. Other organizations, such as CAE and Oliver Wyman, offer similar projections, painting a clear picture of the industry's need for qualified individuals.\n\nThe numbers are staggering: Over the next 20 years, hundreds of thousands of new pilots will be needed globally to meet the demands of a growing aviation sector. This translates into significant opportunities for aspiring pilots who are willing to invest in the necessary training and dedication.\n\nThe highest demand is currently for airline pilots, particularly those qualified to fly large commercial aircraft. However, there's also significant demand for regional airline pilots, corporate pilots, cargo pilots, and even helicopter pilots in specific sectors like offshore oil and gas or emergency medical services. The type of pilot license (e.g., Commercial Pilot License, Airline Transport Pilot License) directly influences the available opportunities.\n\nWhile the shortage is global, certain regions are experiencing more acute challenges. North America and Europe are facing significant shortages due to the aging pilot population and the rapid rebound in air travel. Asia-Pacific, particularly China and India, are experiencing rapid growth in air travel, creating immense demand for new pilots.\n\nThe pilot shortage is already affecting air travel in several ways. Flight cancellations and delays are becoming more frequent, particularly during peak seasons. Airlines are also reducing service to smaller communities due to a lack of pilots to operate those routes. Ultimately, the shortage can lead to increased ticket prices as airlines struggle to meet demand.\n\nAirlines are employing various strategies to attract and retain pilots, including:\n\nExperience is paramount. Airlines generally prefer pilots with substantial flight hours, particularly on turbine-powered aircraft. An Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) certificate, requiring a minimum number of flight hours, is essential for most commercial airline positions. Experience in specific aircraft types can also be highly advantageous.\n\nWhile a college degree is not always mandatory, it's increasingly preferred by major airlines. A degree in aviation-related fields, such as aeronautical science or aviation management, can be particularly beneficial. Regardless of the degree, aspiring pilots must complete flight training and obtain the necessary licenses and ratings from aviation authorities like the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) or EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency).\n\nThe cost of flight training can vary significantly depending on the type of training program and the location. Generally, obtaining a Commercial Pilot License (CPL) can cost between $60,000 and $100,000 or more. Obtaining an ATP certificate, which requires significantly more flight hours and training, adds to this cost.\n\nYes, various financial aid options are available, including:\n\nWhile automation is increasing in aircraft, it's unlikely to eliminate the need for pilots entirely. Pilots are still essential for managing complex situations, making critical decisions, and ensuring the safety of passengers and crew. Technology is more likely to augment the pilot's role, improving efficiency and safety rather than replacing them.\n\nThe long-term career prospects for pilots are excellent, given the projected pilot shortage. Pilots can expect competitive salaries, benefits, and opportunities for career advancement. However, the career requires dedication, continuous learning, and a commitment to safety.\n\nAbsolutely. Despite the challenges of the industry, the current high demand makes this an opportune time to pursue a career as a pilot. The demand is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future, offering excellent job security and earning potential for qualified individuals.\n\nNumerous resources are available to aspiring pilots, including:\n\nIn conclusion, the demand for pilots is demonstrably high and shows no signs of abating in the near future. This challenging landscape presents significant opportunities for those with the passion, dedication, and financial resources to pursue a career in aviation. With careful planning and diligent effort, aspiring pilots can embark on a rewarding and fulfilling career soaring through the skies.",

Technicians also installed the protective fairings on Orion's service module to shield the spacecraft during the launch and ascent phase.\n\nNASA joined forces with the Department of Defense for Artemis II recovery training to make sure the U.S. is prepared to retrieve our astronauts after their historic mission around the moon.\n\nThe space agency unveiled the Artemis II mission patch, designating the mission as \"AII.\" That signifies the second major flight of the Artemis campaign, as well as an endeavor of discovery that seeks to explore for all and by all.\n\nNASA also finished stacking the twin solid rocket boosters for Artemis II. ·\n\n\"In just 100 days, under the bold leadership of President Trump and Acting Administrator Janet Petro, NASA has continued to further American innovation in space,\" Stevens, the NASA spokeswoman, said.",

                            "body": "TOPEKA, Kan. -- Consumers across the U.S. still will be able to buy higher-ethanol blend E15 gasoline this summer, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday, saving them a little money at the pump but risking potential damage to the air and water.\n\nThe emergency waiver issued by the EPA allows retailers in most states to continue selling E15 gasoline after May 1. While the waiver remains in effect only through May 20, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin signaled that he plans to keep issuing waivers through Sept. 15, the date when the federal government typically would allow E15 sales in all states again.\n\nMost gasoline sold across the U.S. is blended with 10% ethanol, but 15% blends are becoming increasingly common, particularly in the Midwest, where most of the nation's corn is grown. E15 gasoline generally costs at least 10 cents less a gallon than E10 gasoline, but the EPA had previously prohibited its sale during the summer over concerns that its use during the summer could increase smog.\n\nBut the EPA has relaxed restrictions on E15, granting a series of short-term waivers in 2022, 2023 and 2024 to allow its sale nationwide through the summer. And last year, the EPA issued a rule allowing year-round sales in eight Midwestern states -- Iowa, usually the nation's top corn producer, as well as Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\nTrump administration officials said Monday's action will lower consumers' costs and give them more choices at the pump while also increasing the demand for corn. They also described it as reducing America's reliance on imported energy.\n\n\"Our nation's great corn growers are critical to helping the U.S. achieve energy independence, which is essential to national security,\" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. produces a surplus of oil but imports some light sweet crude.\n\nWhile the ethanol industry and Iowa officials praised the EPA's action, the Renewable Fuels Association, a trade group for ethanol producers, argued that Congress should approve legislation allowing year-round E15 sales across the U.S.\n\n\"For the economic and energy security benefits of E15 to be fully realized, the marketplace needs long-term certainty,\" President and Chief Executive Officer Geoff Cooper said.\n\nThe biofuels industry and politicians in both major parties argue that ethanol helps farmers, lowers prices at the pump and reduces greenhouse gas because the fuel burns more cleanly than straight gasoline.\n\nBut ethanol consumes about 40% of the nation's corn crop, and environmentalists argue that higher corn production leads to higher use of fertilizers that are a leading source of water pollution.\n\nZack Pistora, Kansas lobbyist for the Sierra Club, said ethanol plants also use high amounts of water, and states like Kansas are worried about the depletion of aquifers. He said it's \"hypocritical\" to portray ethanol as environmentally friendly and said the Trump administration should promote renewable energy, electric vehicles, public transportation and sustainable agriculture.\n\n\"We need to dramatically reduce our fossil fuel dependence, but relying on corn-based ethanol doesn't put our country on the path it needs,\" Pistora said in an interview.\n\nFILE - Storm clouds build above a corn field near Platte City, Mo., Aug. 27, 2024.

                            "body": "Government has still not explained cause of power loss which saw Spain and Portugal disconnected from the European grid for several hours\n\nSpain's prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has hit back at those who blame his government's energy policy for the blackout that affected the Iberian Peninsula on April 28th, although he has still not explained what caused the outage.\n\nSpain and Portugal were plunged into an electricity blackout that lasted several hours after they were disconnected from the European grid. The power loss, which also affected mobile phone coverage, caused travel chaos and the closure of schools, universities, shops and businesses. Portugal's electricity supply depends on Spain's connection to the European grid.\n\nSpain's Socialist-led government has not ruled out any possibility regarding the cause and it has called for patience as an investigation is carried out.\n\n\"I know that Spaniards want to know what happened and they want to know as soon as possible,\" Mr Sánchez said as he addressed Spain's congress for the first time since the blackout, before warning that this \"will take time\".\n\nHe praised Spaniards and institutions for their response to the crisis, saying it had brought out \"the best of the Spanish people\".\n\nMr Sánchez confirmed that three \"disturbances\" in the national grid had preceded the disconnection. The first, he said, was in southern Spain and the second two, which occurred just moments before the outage, were in the southwest, where much of the country's solar energy is generated.\n\nThe revelation, soon after the blackout, about the location of the latter two network glitches had triggered speculation that the blackout may have been caused by a solar generation overload.\n\nThe outage has also revived calls from the conservative opposition for the government to halt its nuclear phase-out plan.\n\n\"You were so intent on being the greenest in the world that you have led Spaniards into the dark,\" said Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the main opposition People's Party. \"Your duty is to accept that your energy model has failed.\"\n\nThe leader of the far-right Vox party, Santiago Abascal, ridiculed the prime minister and accused him of \"playing at being Mr Solar Panel\".\n\nHowever, Mr Sánchez said that \"there is no empirical evidence telling us that the incident was caused by an excess of renewables or a lack of nuclear power stations\".\n\nThe nuclear debate, he said, was irrelevant in this context.\n\n\"Linking this blackout to nuclear plants is not just irresponsible, it is also enormously manipulative,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this week, the EU commissioner for energy and housing, Dan Jørgensen, congratulated the governments of Spain and Portugal for their response to the crisis and said \"there is no reason to believe\" that renewables had caused the power loss.\n\nSpain has increased its renewable output substantially since Mr Sánchez took office in 2018 and when the blackout happened, two-thirds of the country's electricity needs were being met by solar and wind generation.",

Kennedy Jr. at its other health counterparts.\n\nThe FDA has laid off 3,500 employees under Kennedy's massive restructuring of U.S. health agencies, raising questions over its impact on drug reviews.\n\n\"On the question of productivity, my center leaders have assured me that the FDA will reach its PDUFA (goal date) targets,\" Makary said in an interview posted on the Inside Medicine Substack.\n\nReuters reported in early April that mass firings at the agency have removed employees critical to reviewing new medicines, including all staff responsible for managing records such as new product applications.\n\nMakary also said that he could make independent decisions at the agency.\n\n\"No one above me has been or will be making decisions on products. Secretary Kennedy may have strong recommendations, which he has a right to, but I make my decisions based on the two guiding principles of gold standard science and common sense,\" Makary added.\n\n(Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)",

Energy and tech executives have gathered at the Hamm Institute for American Energy in Oklahoma City to discuss how the U.S. can meet the growing energy needs for AI data centers. Over the past decade, Big Tech companies have mostly invested in renewable power as they strive to cut their carbon dioxide emissions; however, they are now adopting a more pro-fossil fuel stance after the Trump administration ditched the country's climate goals.\n\n\"To have the energy we need for the grid, it's going to take an all of the above approach for a period of time,\" Kevin Miller, Amazon's vice president of global data centers, said. \"We're not surprised by the fact that we're going to need to add some thermal generation to meet the needs in the short term.\"\n\nThe world is witnessing unprecedented electricity demand growth.\n\nLast year, power sector consulting firm Grid Strategies published a report titled \"The Era of Flat Power Demand is Over,\" which pointed out that United States grid planners--utilities and regional transmission operators (RTOs)--had nearly doubled growth projections in their five-year demand forecasts. For the first time in decades, demand for electricity in the U.S. is projected to grow by as much as 15% over the next decade driven by the Artificial Intelligence (AI), clean energy manufacturing, and cryptocurrencies boom.\n\nThe International Energy Agency has projected that global data center electricity consumption will jump from 460 terawatt-hours in 2022 to 1,000 terawatt-hours in 2026. According to Goldman Sachs, escalating electricity needs from running AI data centers will generate downstream investment opportunities that will benefit utilities, renewable energy generation, and industrial sectors.\n\nRelated: Scotland's Sole Oil Refinery Shuts Down for Good\n\nThe investment bank has forecast that data center power demand will grow at 15% compound annual growth rate from 2023-2030, with data centers consuming 8% of total U.S. electricity output at the end of the forecast period compared to ~3% currently. Analysts estimate that ~47 GW of additional power generation capacity will be required to meet the growth in U.S. data center power demand by 2030. Similarly, Anthropic estimates that the U.S. will need 50 gigawatts of new power by 2027, equivalent to about 50 nuclear reactors. Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark says AI demand will drive the development of \"new and novel sources\" of power over the longer term.\n\nSurging power demand has also brought the nuclear sector back into play. The big nuclear rally kicked off last year after NuScale (NYSE:SMR) signed an agreement with Standard Power to supply the data center provider with small modular reactors (SMRs). Standard Power--a developer of modular data centers-will use NuScale Power's power solutions at two separate sites, where up to 12 SMRs (at each site) would be used to provide power for new data centers. Suddenly, the market took note of SMRs as a viable solution for data centers struggling to keep up with surging power demands by artificial intelligence (AI) computing.\n\nThe long-term outlook for the nuclear sector remains bullish, with nuclear power expected to meet surging AI demand and lower greenhouse gas emissions. The International Energy Agency has projected that global data center electricity consumption will jump from 460 terawatt-hours in 2022 to 1,000 terawatt-hours in 2026.\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs, escalating electricity needs from running AI data centers will generate downstream investment opportunities that will benefit utilities, renewable energy generation, and industrial sectors.

Analysts estimate that ~47 GW of additional power generation capacity will be required to meet the growth in U.S. data center power demand by 2030.\n\nLast year, 34 countries, including the U.S., pledged to increasingly deploy nuclear power to lower their reliance on fossil fuels. According to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) report Electricity 2024, nuclear power generation is forecast to reach an all-time high globally in 2025, exceeding the previous record set in 2021 as new reactors begin commercial operations in multiple markets, including China, India, South Korea, and Europe; output from France climbs and several plants in Japan are restarted.",

                            "body": "To the point * Challenging nickel demand: the demand for nickel is expected to double while conventional nickel production emits around 20 tons of CO2 per one ton of nickel * Sustainable new process for nickel production: Researchers found a way to extract nickel from low-grade ores using hydrogen plasma instead of carbon. The one-step process is CO2-free and saves energy and time. * Upscaling possible: For upscaling, implementing short arcs with high currents, integrating an external electromagnetic stirring device beneath the furnace, or employing gas injection, is needed, making sure that the unreduced melt continuously reaches the reaction interface. To combat climate change and achieve a climate-neutral industry, carbon emissions must be drastically reduced. A key part of this transition is replacing carbon-based energy carriers with electricity, particularly in transport and industrial applications. However, this shift heavily depends on nickel, a critical material used in batteries and stainless steel. By 2040, the demand for nickel is expected to double due to the increasing electrification of the infrastructures and transport systems. Yet, producing one ton of nickel currently emits around 20 tons of CO2, raising concerns about shifting the environmental burden from transportation to metallurgy. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Sustainable Materials (MPI-SusMat) have now developed a carbon-free, energy-saving method for nickel extraction. Their approach also enables the use of low-grade nickel ores, which have been overlooked due to the complexity of conventional extraction processes. The Max Planck team now published their results in the journal Nature. One single step to green nickel \"If we continue producing nickel in the conventional way and use it for electrification, we are just shifting the problem rather than solving it,\" explains Ubaid Manzoor, PhD researcher at MPI-SusMat and first author of the publication. Manzoor and his colleagues have developed a new method to extract nickel from ores in a single step, using hydrogen plasma instead of carbon-based processes. This approach not only cuts CO2 emissions by 84% but is also up to 18% more energy-efficient when powered by renewable electricity and green hydrogen. Traditionally, industry relies on high-grade ores, as extracting nickel from lower-grade ores is far more complex due to their chemically intricate composition. Unlike iron, which can be reduced in a single step by removing oxygen, nickel in low-grade ores is chemically bound within complex magnesium silicates or iron oxides. Conventional extraction involves multiple stages like calcination, smelting, reduction, and refining, which are energy-intensive and have a large carbon footprint. A major breakthrough of this method is its ability to process low-grade nickel ores (which account for 60% of total nickel reserves) in a single reactor furnace, where smelting, reduction, and refining occur simultaneously, producing a refined ferronickel alloy directly. \"By using hydrogen plasma and controlling the thermodynamic processes inside the electric arc furnace, we are able to break down the complex structure of the minerals in low-grade nickel ores into simpler ionic species - even without using catalysts\", explains Professor Isnaldi Souza Filho, head of the group \"Sustainable Synthesis of Materials\" at MPI-SusMat and corresponding author of the publication. Towards industrial application This method not only reduces emissions and energy consumption, but also broadens the spectrum of usable nickel ores, making extraction more cost-effective and sustainable. The next step for the Max Planck team is scaling up the process for industrial applications. \"The reduction of nickel ores into simpler ionic species occurs only at the reaction interface, not throughout the entire melt. In an upscaled system, it is crucial to ensure that unreduced melt continuously reaches the reaction interface,\" explains Manzoor. \"This can be achieved by implementing short arcs with high currents, integrating an external electromagnetic stirring device beneath the furnace, or employing gas injection.\" These are well-established industrial techniques, making integration into existing processes feasible. The green nickel production route opens the door to a more sustainable electrification of the transport sector. The reduced nickel alloy can be used directly in stainless steel production and, with additional refinement, as a material for battery electrodes. Additionally, the slag produced during the reduction process can serve as a valuable resource for the construction industry, including brick and cement production. The same process can also be applied for cobalt, which is used in electric vehicles and energy storage systems. The research was funded by an Advanced Grant of the European Research Council.",

                            "body": "A rocket launch from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base did not go to plan after the spacecraft experienced a midair \"mishap.\"\n\nFirefly Aerospace, the Texas-based spaceflight company that manufactured the rocket in question, said the issue put a satellite owned by Lockheed Martin in a \"lower than planned orbit\" following an early-morning takeoff April 29.\n\nThe potential failed mission was Firefly's sixth test of its Alpha rocket, which it is developing for commercial launches to compete in a market long dominated by Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nThe company also achieved a major victory earlier in 2025 when it landed a spacecraft on the moon in March as part of a mission funded by NASA.\n\nWas there a rocket launch in California?\n\nFirefly provided a live stream of the Tuesday, April 29, launch as its Alpha rocket ascended into low-Earth orbit following a takeoff at 6:37 a.m. PT from Vandenberg Space Force Base in Southern California.\n\nBut during the webcast, several particles could be seen flying off the rocket during stage separation as the second stage propelled Lockheed's satellite further into space, Reuters reported. While the Lockheed satellite remained intact, a camera on the second stage showed its engine firing without its nozzle.\n\nWhat to know about Lockheed Martin satellite\n\nThe mission, known as \"message in a booster,\" was the first of a planned 25 launches in the next five years under an agreement between Firefly and Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe Alpha rocket's payload was a Lockheed satellite called LM 400 Technology Demonstrator, which is meant to advance space technologies for its customers like the Pentagon.\n\n\"Our customers have told us they need rapid advancement of new mission capabilities,\" Bob Behnken, a director at Lockheed Martin Space, said in a statement at the time. \"This agreement with Firefly further diversifies our access to space, allowing us to continue quickly flight demonstrating the cutting-edge technology we are developing for them.\"\n\nThe Alpha rocket itself is classified as a small-lift launch vehicle capable of carrying more than 2,200 pounds of cargo to orbit.\n\nFirefly to conduct investigation with Space Force, FAA after 'mishap'\n\nFirefly said in a mission update that it will investigate the cause of the \"mishap\" with Lockheed Martin, the U.S. Space Force and the Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial launches.\n\nEngineers believe the problem occurred during separation of Alpha's core stage booster with its second stage less than three minutes into the flight. The faulty separation \"impacted the Stage 2 Lightning engine nozzle, putting the vehicle in a lower than planned orbit,\" Firefly wrote in an update on social media site X.\n\nFirefly famous for 2025 moon landing, SpaceX Firefly Blue Ghost mission\n\nFirefly made a name for itself earlier this year when its Blue Ghost lunar lander became the second-ever commercial spacecraft to make it to the surface of the moon.\n\nAfter launching Jan. 15, 2025, atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the spacecraft managed to touch down about six weeks later on March 3 on the moon's Earth-facing side on a mission to deploy 10 NASA science instruments. The ensuing 14 days of surface operations were meant to help the U.S. space agency pave the way for humans to return in the years ahead under its Artemis program.\n\nContributing: Reuters",

The meeting was attended by key officials including Special Assistant to the Chief Minister Syed Qasim Naveed Qamar, Transport Secretary Asad Zaman, and Sindh Mass Transit Authority MD Kamal Dayo.\n\nThe unified system aims to streamline operations of ride-hailing services, enhance service quality, and ensure passenger safety. \"We are working towards bringing all taxi services under a single, efficient system that guarantees fare transparency and strict vehicle inspections,\" said Minister Memon.\n\nAs part of its green transport strategy, the Sindh government is fast-tracking the launch of an EV taxi service. The initiative is expected to help modernize the taxi network and significantly reduce environmental pollution in the metropolis.\n\nTo make EV taxis more accessible, the government is exploring easy financing options for the public, including installment plans.\n\nFurther emphasizing gender-inclusive mobility, Minister Memon announced the launch of a pink scooter program for women. In the first phase, 1,000 scooters will be distributed free of charge to working women and female students. \"This initiative reflects our commitment to women's empowerment and their access to safe and reliable transport,\" he said.\n\nAdditionally, the government plans to phase out conventional buses in Karachi, relocating them to other districts and replacing them with electric buses. Double-decker buses are set to arrive in June, with another fleet expected by early July.\n\nTo support this transition, infrastructure work is underway, including EV charging stations and designated parking areas. The upcoming provincial budget is expected to allocate increased funds to further expand and improve public transport facilities.\n\nThis initiative marks a significant step in Karachi's shift toward sustainable, inclusive, and technology-driven transportation.",

                            "body": "Gurgaon: In punishing summer months, power outages could get worse. Haryana's calculation for power demand this summer estimates that the state will hit a peak of 15,500MW, 5% higher than 2024's peak of 14,700 MW. But electricity supply will fall short by 1,000 MW to 3,300 MW every month from May till Oct.\n\nDiscoms have already started enforcing 8-hour daily power cuts in rural areas and unscheduled outages are common in urban regions too.\n\nOfficials told TOI on Wednesday that the frequency of outages is likely to go up because of the power deficit.\n\nIn May, the deficit has been calculated at 1,792MW as peak demand is expected to reach 13,000MW.\n\nJune and July are set to be the harshest, as electricity demand is expected to go beyond 15,000 MW across the state. A power department said on Wednesday that the deficit has been assessed to 3,298 MW in June, and 2,992 MW in July.\n\nAug, they hope, will see timely arrival of monsoon rain, helping reduce power demand. Still, deficit for the month has been pegged as 1,807MW. Though demand should decline further in Sept and Oct, the state estimates that it won't be able to meet all supply needs because power output from thermal plants reduces during the rainy season over difficulties in mining coal at this time of the year.\n\n\"The power department has projected deficit in the range of 1,000 MW to 3,300 MW during the summer months,\" the official said.\n\nHaryana gets electricity from multiple sources. Nearly 5000 MW comes from power plants within the state. Another 7000 MW comes from various agreements with public and private entities. In addition, states purchase power from the exchange on a daily basis.\n\nOfficials said among the reasons that a power deficit is anticipated is because of no supply from CGPL Mundra, Faridabad Gas Power Plant and J&K Baglihar hydro power plant. CGPL Mundra is locked in a legal dispute with Haryana govt over tariffs, and Faridabad and Baglihar plants are down because of technical issues.\n\n\"To meet the shortfall, the state is planning to purchase power through short-term agreements on a day-to-day basis and through power exchange with other states, which create surplus electricity,\" the official said. Officials said that an increase in demand during summer months and the paddy season could also increase costs of purchase.\n\n\"Since discoms of other states have also floated tenders for procuring power on a short-term basis, this competition is likely to lead to a surge in costs of power. The tariff for peak hours is hovering around Rs 10 per unit. On average, discoms normally purchase power at Rs 3-4 per unit,\" the official said.\n\nIn 2022, a shortage of coal in thermal plants and a dispute with Adani Power over electricity rates led to supply deficits in Haryana in April and May, forcing discoms to resort to outages. The state had to later purchase power at higher-than-usual rates to make up for the shortfall. To mitigate this crisis, the power department, in 2023, signed several long-term and short-term power purchase agreements, including with Adani Power.",

The new site will offer product information, provide case study examples, and offer contact information to help customers find products that offer them a pathway to reduce their emissions using Toyota's proven hydrogen-powered fuel cell technologies.\n\nThe new website was announced at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo, where Toyota is showcasing how fuel cell technology can be used as a source of cleaner power to generate electricity to power devices and vehicle powertrains. Applications for fuel cells include stationary power generation capabilities, Class 8 semi-truck powertrains, modular commercial systems power and other innovations.\n\nToyota's fuel cell stacks can be found in a range of products, from the 2025 Toyota Miral FCEV sedan to replacing diesel engines as backup power generators. Toyota fuel cells are also employed as powertrains in heavy machinery such as port and cargo-handling equipment and passenger buses.\n\nTMNA has been developing hydrogen fuel cell technologies in the US for more than 30 years. The 2015 Toyota Mirai sedan was the first mass-produced fuel cell electric vehicle to go on sale to the public. Since then, the Gardena, California-based Hydrogen Headquarters (NA H2HQ) office has expanded operations and use cases and has performed vigorous tests with fuel cells in temperatures lower than -20° Fahrenheit in Canada to nearly 150° in Death Valley.\n\nGlobally, Toyota has sold more than 2,700 commercial fuel cell units to more than 100 customers. Toyota has prepared to assemble fuel cell module kits domestically in Georgetown, Kentucky.\n\nAt a keynote during the ACT Expo's Hydrogen Workshop, Toyota Group Vice President of Powertrain Engineering Jordan Choby announced plans to introduce hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric Class 8 heavy-duty trucks as part of an effort to reduce the number of diesel-powered tractor trailers servicing Toyota's North America Parts Center California (NAPCC). To support the new hydrogen trucks in the fleet, the company also announced plans for a new hydrogen fueling station to be built on the NAPCC campus, as well as plans to further invest and vertically integrate into the hydrogen ecosystem.\n\nToyota also debuted its next-generation fuel cell technology in North America, the Toyota Gen 3 FC system. For heavy truck powertrains, the Gen 3 FC is anticipated to go more than 600,000 miles (1 million kilometers) without a need for major service, a maintenance schedule on par with comparable diesel-powered trucks.",

                            "body": "Wojtek Piorko, managing director - Africa, Vertiv. (Image: Supplied)\n\nThe demand for data centres in Africa is growing, driven by several factors. These include government regulations for local data security, an increasing demand for cloud computing among small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) and growing investment by domestic players. In turn, as the data centre industry develops across the continent, further fuelled by the ongoing rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) and the related need for increasing rack densities, this also brings with it escalating cooling requirements.\n\nWhile there are a number of data centre cooling technologies that are already tried and trusted, including air cooling, direct-to-chip cooling and immersion cooling, these could offer exciting opportunities for noteworthy improvements in data centre energy efficiency.\n\nImmersion cooling - a cooling concept that submerges server equipment in a cooling fluid to moderate and control its temperature - is a highly efficient cooling method that should significantly reduce energy consumption when compared to traditional air-cooling systems. While still a relatively new technology in Africa, liquid and immersion cooling are expected to gain traction locally, offering a real potential to revolutionise data centre cooling on the continent.\n\nImmersion cooling is a liquid cooling technology in which servers and other rack components are submerged in a thermally conductive dielectric liquid or fluid within a sealed tank. This liquid, selected for its excellent thermal transfer properties, absorbs heat from IT equipment for efficient HPC cooling. The benefits of immersion cooling include the following:\n\nImmersion cooling absorbs 100% of the heat from the server components, as they are fully submerged in the fluid, minimising the need for air cooling units and reducing heat transfer steps. However, room cooling units remain essential in a data centre to cool any equipment and heat loads that are not addressed by direct liquid cooling. Air quality and humidity are regulated using a filtration system to prevent dust build-up, facilitate clean air circulation and filter fresh air introduced, maintaining breathable conditions.\n\nAs an added benefit, liquid cooling systems should also offer a quieter data centre environment. Unlike the noise prevalent in air-cooled centres due to extensive air recirculation, liquid cooling is predominantly silent, with only the soft hum of pumps, significantly reducing overall noise levels.\n\nChoosing the most beneficial cooling solution for your data centre is critical, because data centres use significant amounts of energy during operation and generate large amounts of heat in turn. Overheating can damage server equipment, potentially leading to unwanted downtime, while overheated computer equipment can also create premature failures.\n\nImmersion cooling can enhance data centre performance by efficiently managing high heat outputs. In HPC and AI workloads, immersion cooling systems can deliver cooling capacities exceeding 200kW per tank (42 or 52 rack units). This technology can thus provide an effective solution for intense computational demands in a reduced footprint.\n\nAs Africa's digital economy continues to expand, the demand for efficient, scalable and reliable data centre cooling solutions will only increase. Liquid and immersion cooling technologies present a powerful complement to traditional cooling methods, offering superior efficiency, reduced environmental impact and the ability to support high-density computing and AI applications.\n\nFor more information on Vertiv's complete thermal management offering, please click here.",

                            "body": "TEHRAN - A U.S. Navy fighter jet was lost in the Red Sea following a heavy assault on an American aircraft carrier by Yemeni forces.\n\nF/A-18E Super Hornet plunged into the Red Sea after sliding off the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman during an evasive maneuver in a desperate attempt to dodge incoming Yemeni missile fire.\n\nAccording to CNN, a U.S. official said the Truman made a sudden, sharp turn to evade incoming fire, which caused the jet to slide off the deck and into the sea.\n\nNavy officials stated that the F/A-18 was being towed through the hangar bay when the crew lost control causing the jet to fall overboard.\n\n\"The aircraft and tow tractor were lost overboard,\" the U.S. Navy said in a statement. \"Sailors towing the aircraft acted quickly to move clear before it fell. An investigation is underway.\"\n\nAnother U.S. official told CNN that the jet has since sunk. Other reports suggest the fighter jet slipped when Yemeni fire forced the aircraft carrier to make a \"hard turn\".\n\nEach F/A-18 Super Hornet costs more than $60 million.\n\nEarlier, Yemeni forces claimed responsibility for a military operation targeting the Harry S. Truman and its escort ships in the Red Sea.\n\nThe government in Sanaa described the strikes as a swift and direct retaliation for two massacres carried out by the U.S. in Saada and the Yemeni capital, Sanaa.\n\nBrigadier General Yahya Saree, spokesperson for the Yemeni Armed Forces, stated the attack involved naval units, drones, and missile forces, which launched cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and drones at the carrier.\n\nSaree said the assault forced the Truman to retreat from its original position and move to the far northern area of the Red Sea.\n\nHe added that the operation was \"in response to two massacres committed by the American enemy in Yemen, the first in the capital, Sanaa, and the second targeting a shelter housing African migrants in Saada Governorate, resulting in dozens of civilian casualties.\"\n\nThe Yemeni Armed Forces vowed to continue targeting the carrier and any hostile warships in both the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea until U.S. aggression against Yemen ends.\n\nIn solidarity with the Palestinian people and Gaza's resistance fighters, Yemeni drones also targeted a strategic Israeli site in the occupied Ashkelon area using a Yafa drone.\n\nSaree affirmed that the Armed Forces will continue blocking Israeli navigation in the Red and Arabian seas and support Palestinians until the U.S.-backed genocidal war ends and the siege on Gaza is lifted.\n\nYemeni forces have repeatedly launched attacks on U.S. warships since America increased its military presence in the region to protect Israeli interests, which Ansarallah targets in solidarity with the people of Gaza.",

The spacecraft arrived at the Tiangong space station 6.5 hours later, completing its rendezvous and docking at 11:49 a.m. EDT (1549 GMT, 11:49 p.m. Beijing time).\n\nThe Shenzhou 19 crew -- Cai Xuzhe, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze, who have been living aboard Tiangong since October -- greeted the three Shenzhou 20 astronauts inside Tiangong around 90 minutes later, once the hatch between the spacecraft and space station was opened.\n\nAfter spending a few days together, all six astronauts then participated in a handover ceremony on Sunday (April 27), seeing the Shenzhou 20 crew take command of Tiangong.\n\n\"This key symbolizes not only the handover between our two crew groups, but also a heavy mission and responsibility. Now, I'm handing the key into your hands, and you will be responsible for managing, caring for and maintaining the space station,\" said Cai, commander of Shenzhou 19.\n\n\"Thank you, Shenzhou 19 crew, for taking such good care of our space home,\" Chen Dong, Shenzhou 20 commander, said after receiving the key. \"We assure you and our country and the people that we will, just like you, carefully and meticulously complete every task and do our part well,\" said Chen.\n\nRelated stories:\n\n-- China's Shenzhou 20 astronauts arrive at Tiangong space station (video)\n\n-- Tiangong astronauts experiment with AI robot and more to kick off busy year for Chinese human spaceflight (video)\n\n-- China's space station, Tiangong: A complete guide\n\nChen's crewmates are Chen Zhongrui, a former pilot in the People's Liberation Army Air Force, and Wang Jie, an aerospace engineer, both of whom were selected as astronauts in 2020 and are making their first visits to space. The trio will spend around six months aboard Tiangong.\n\nTheir mission will include extravehicular activities, or spacewalks, and outreach events, as well as conducting a range of science experiments and installing and retrieving science payloads outside Tiangong.\n\nThe Shenzhou 19 astronauts, meanwhile, are now preparing to return home. They will soon depart in their Shenzhou spacecraft and are due to land in the Dongfeng landing area, near Jiuquan spaceport, on April 29. Their mission involved record-breaking spacewalks, experiments and cooperating with an AI robot.",

                            "body": "Project Kuiper, a subsidiary of billionaire Jeff Bezos' Amazon, is meant to one day rival the satellite constellation that SpaceX founder Elon Musk's Starlink has been building in orbit for years.\n\nAmazon is preparing to launch its debut batch of satellites into orbit as it seeks to establish its own internet service for customers worldwide.\n\nProject Kuiper, a subsidiary of billionaire Jeff Bezos' online commerce behemoth, is meant to one day rival the satellite constellation that SpaceX founder Elon Musk's Starlink has been building in orbit for years.\n\nThose $10 billion plans could be put in motion as early as Monday, April 28 with the first of about 80 rocket launches to deploy a total of around 3,200 Amazon's satellites hundreds of miles above Earth. Establishing the internet constellation may require a series of rocket launches to get the satellites into space, but the initiative is seperate from Bezos' Blue Origin spaceflight company.\n\nThe first delivery of 27 Kuiper satellites will pave the way in the years ahead for Amazon to build a satellite broadband network in what's called low-Earth orbit - an altitude that allows for things like satellites to circle Earth fairly quickly.\n\nHere's everything to know about Project Kuiper and the upcoming launch:\n\nWhen is the Amazon launch?\n\nAmazon will send 27 Kuiper satellites into low Earth orbit no earlier than 7 p.m. ET on Monday, April 28. A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket has a two-hour launch window ending at 9 p.m. to get off the ground from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nFollowing the liftoff, the rocket will help to deploy the satellites at an altitude of 280 miles above Earth. The satellites will then autonomously use their electric propulsion systems to ascend to 392 miles high, where they can orbit Earth once every 90 minutes, according to Amazon.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance will manage the launch and deployment until all of the satellites have separated from the rocket. At that point, Amazon's Kuiper team will take control of the constellation, which they will manage from an operations center in Redmond, Washington.\n\nWhat is Amazon's Project Kuiper?\n\nThe mission, named \"KA-01\" for Kuiper Atlas 1, will be just the first to deliver a batch of satellites into low-Earth orbit as part of Amazon's Project Kuiper to provide high-speed internet to customers around the globe.\n\nIn October 2023, United Launch Alliance sent two Amazon Project Kuiper prototype satellites into space via an Atlas V rocket. This time, though, the satellites have not only been significantly upgraded, but represent the largest deployment for Amazon, the company said.\n\n\"We've designed some of the most advanced communications satellites ever built, and every launch is an opportunity to add more capacity and coverage to our network,\" Project Kuiper Vice President Rajeev Badyal said in a statement. \"This is just the start of our journey, and we have all the pieces in place to learn and adapt as we prepare to launch again and again over the coming years.\"\n\nThe first-generation satellite system will include more than 3,200 advanced low-Earth orbit satellites, which will be delivered across more than 80 launches in the coming years.\n\nThe United Launch Alliance, a launch service provider based in Colorado, will deploy a majority the satellites on its Atlas V and Vulcan Centaur rockets. However, Amazon is also planning to contract with Arianespace, SpaceX and Blue Origin - which Bezos also owns - for orbital deliveries.\n\nSpaceX's reusable Falcon 9 rocket has become one of the most active in the world - a go-to for NASA and even other private companies launching spacecraft into orbit. Musk's commercial space transportation company also leads the way in satellite launches, having launched more than 6,000 operational Starlink satellites into orbit since 2019.\n\nAmazon's Project Kuiper subsidiary is hoping to compete with Starlink in that market with an internet service of its own.\n\nHow to watch Amazon launch Project Kuiper satellites\n\nAmazon and the United Launch Alliance will provide a livestream of the launch that will begin approximately 20 minutes ahead of liftoff.\n\nThe webcast will be available here.\n\nWhat states may be able to see the ULA rocket launch?\n\nThe satellite delivery will be the heaviest payload the United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket has ever flown. To accommodate it, the Atlas V will be equipped with five solid rocket boosters for added liftoff power in addition to its main booster and a payload fairing containing the satellites, making it 77 feet high.\n\nFor that reason, there's a chance people beyond Florida - including in states as far north as New York or Indiana - could see the launch vehicle light up the night sky.\n\nThe United Launch Alliance released a helpful graphic showing where and when spectators could see it in certain parts of the U.S., which Florida Today, A USA TODAY Network publication, broke down here.",

                            "body": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iran finally extinguished a fire Monday at a southern port rocked by an explosion as the death toll in the blast rose to at least 70 people killed, authorities said.\n\nSatellite images analyzed by The Associated Press also showed the devastation of the explosion that injured more than 1,000 people. The photos from Planet Labs PBC came as local news reports from the site raised more questions about the cause of the blast Saturday at the Shahid Rajaei port near Bandar Abbas.\n\nIranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni announced the fire had been put out, while provincial emergency health official Mehrdad Hasanzadeh gave the death toll.\n\nThe port reportedly took in a chemical component needed for solid fuel for ballistic missiles -- something denied by authorities though they've not explained the source of the power that caused such destruction.\n\nThe blast Saturday disintegrated a building next to the blast site, which appeared to be in a row where other containers once stood, the satellite photos showed. It also shredded the majority of another building just to the west.\n\nThe force of the blast also could be seen, with what appeared to be two craters measure some 50 meters (165 feet) across. Other containers nearby appeared smashed and distended by the explosion and the intense fire that followed.\n\nREAD MORE: Iran President Pezeshkian visits the injured\n\nSmoke rises following an explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port in Bandar Abbas, Iran, April 27, 2025. Iranian Red Crescent/WANA (West Asia News Agency) Handout via REUTERS\n\nThe fire still burned at the site Monday, some two days after the initial explosion that happened just as Iran began a third round of negotiations with the United States over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.\n\nAuthorities still haven't offered an explanation for the explosion.\n\nPrivate security firm Ambrey says the port received missile fuel chemical in March. It was part of a shipment of ammonium perchlorate from China by two vessels to Iran, first reported in January by the Financial Times. The chemical used to make solid propellant for rockets was going to be used to replenish Iran's missile stocks, which had been depleted by its direct attacks on Israel during the war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Iranian military denied receiving the chemical shipment.\n\nSocial media footage of the explosion saw reddish-hued smoke rising from the fire just before the detonation. That suggests a chemical compound being involved in the blast, like in the 2020 Beirut port explosion.\n\nLate Sunday, Iran's semiofficial ILNA news agency quoted Saeed Jafari, the CEO of marine services company working at the port, as saying there were false statements about the cargo that detonated, which he called \"very dangerous.\"\n\n\"The incident happened following a false statement about the dangerous goods and delivering it without documents and tags,\" Jafari said.\n\nAnother report by the semiofficial ISNA news agency claimed the cargo that caused the blast was not reported to customs authorities as well.\n\nOnly high-level authorities in Iran, such as its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, could circumvent normal procedures at the port.\n\nA helicopter extinguishes fire following an explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port in Bandar Abbas, Iran, April 27, 2025.

                            "body": "This article is part of our special report EU-Kazakhstan relations: A strategic and economic evolution towards a regional and global role.\n\nKazakhstan has the potential to become a major player in the emerging hydrogen market, not only in the context of enhanced energy connectivity in Central Asia but also as a supplier to the European market.\n\nRecently, Germany organised a training week on green hydrogen in Astana as part of a strategic push to promote and unlock Kazakhstan's potential as a future hub for green hydrogen production.\n\nParticipating in the event, Kazakhstan's Vice Minister of Energy, Bakytzhan Ilyas, emphasised the strategic importance of green hydrogen for sustainable economic development and climate goals.\n\nWith significant renewable energy resources and a strong industrial base, Kazakhstan is well-positioned for pilot projects and infrastructure development in this field. This was also highlighted by German Ambassador Monika Iwersen.\n\nChallenges amid potential\n\nAccording to an assessment by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Kazakhstan has good potential for large-scale production of both green and blue hydrogen.\n\nThe EBRD also highlights the country's strategic position on the Silk Road, which links Europe and China, and identifies domestic demands for hydrogen in the refining, ammonia, and mining sectors.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) advises caution in developing hydrogen production, particularly in the Central Asian region, where water scarcity is an issue.\n\nFor this reason, UNECE suggests focusing on blue hydrogen as a transitional solution. Kazakhstan can unlock additional opportunities only by comprehending the connections between different elements and implementing effective systems.\n\nNot a simple task\n\nIn 2024, Kazakhstan's Energy Ministry approved the concept for the development of hydrogen energy until 2040. By that time, at least 50 per cent of the planned total production is expected to be green hydrogen.\n\nHowever, as Manuel Andresh, head of the Hydrogen Diplomacy Office in Astana, has acknowledged, the transition to green energy is far from simple. Green hydrogen currently plays a limited role in Kazakhstan's industry.\n\nIt is mainly used in refineries and fertiliser production, but holds promise for decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors. The office is guiding Kazakh companies in shifting from fossil fuel-based to green hydrogen through free technical and financial analysis.\n\nNevertheless, Andresh is optimistic that the country's favourable geography and experience in energy exports position it well to become a key green hydrogen exporter, particularly to Europe via routes like the Trans-Caspian International Transport Corridor.\n\nSupplying the EU\n\nAt the Samarkand summit in early April, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev launched a major project involving his country, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan to deliver green energy to Europe via the Caspian-Black Sea corridor.\n\nAccording to Dutch think tank Clingendael, this green energy corridor could allow the three countries to supply renewable electricity to the European market while the EU seeks to strengthen its energy security.\n\nBy positioning itself as a key producer and transport hub of renewable energy, green hydrogen and critical raw materials, the Caspian Sea region could become an alternative for the EU to diversify away from Russian energy supplies.\n\nAlthough Russia's influence on these countries challenges Europe's energy security interests, investments could help the bloc strengthen its geopolitical standing in the region and secure access to critical raw materials.\n\nDecarbonise first, exports later\n\nCarnegie Endowment suggests that Kazakhstan should prioritise using green hydrogen to decarbonise its industries, rather than focusing solely on exports, given the slow development of global hydrogen markets and the lack of transport infrastructure.\n\nInstead, decarbonising steel, chemicals, and refining industries could offer greater economic and environmental gains. The author cites Chile and Morocco as countries already shifting from exports to developing green industries for higher-value products.\n\nAlthough Kazakhstan has the renewable resources to produce green hydrogen competitively and the development concept marks progress, it still lacks clear targets or incentives to drive industrial decarbonisation.\n\nBut with EU support in building regulatory frameworks, attracting investment, and promoting research, Kazakhstan has the potential to become a regional leader in clean industrial development, rather than relying on uncertain export markets.",

The state is also promoting rooftop solar installations and building a skilled workforce. Lucknow, Apr 29 (PTI) The Uttar Pradesh government is advancing policy-driven efforts to accelerate green revolution in the state and has signed initial agreements with the Smart Energy Council of Australia and the Hinduja Group.\n\nThe government has set an ambitious target to generate 500 gigawatts of solar energy by 2030, an official statement said.\n\nWith a vision to transform Uttar Pradesh, especially regions like Bundelkhand, Vindhya, and adjoining areas, into a hub for solar energy, the government is taking policy-driven efforts, it added.\n\n\"The state recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Smart Energy Council of Australia and the Hinduja Group in a significant move. The government has set an ambitious target to generate 500 gigawatts of solar energy by 2030,\" it said.\n\nThe government also noted that as solar capacity expands, so will local employment -- from panel manufacturing to installation, maintenance, grid integration, and transmission.\n\nThe government has launched the Solar Mitra Yojana to build a skilled workforce, it said.\n\nWhen Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath took office in 2017, the state's solar energy production was just 288 MW, it said, adding that \"Today, that figure has increased tenfold, and the growth is still ongoing. Under the Solar Energy Policy 2022, a near-term target of 2,200 MW has been set.\"\n\n\"To realize this vision, solar parks will be established across all municipal corporations, solar grids will be installed along expressways and railway tracks, and streetlights will be powered by solar energy. Transmission infrastructure will also be reinforced, with a special emphasis on Bundelkhand,\" the government said.\n\nAyodhya is being developed as a solar city and in a phased manner, the remaining 16 municipal corporations and Noida are also being transformed into solar cities, according to the statement.\n\n\"Key solar parks are planned in Jhansi, Jalaun, Chitrakoot, Lalitpur, Kanpur City, and Kanpur Dehat. Notably, the Bundelkhand Expressway is set to become India's first solar expressway, marking a milestone in sustainable infrastructure,\" it added.\n\nThe government is aggressively promoting rooftop solar installations under PM Surya Ghar Yojana to boost adoption. The target for rooftop panels in FY 2025-26 has been doubled to 2.65 lakh units, it added.",

Portugal and France were affected too. It is a developing situation at the time of writing, with many, many people without power and without access to critical services like transport, payment systems and internet. Not only is this an unprecedented blackout, it occurred right at the peak of Spain's solar power generation in the middle of the day: It has only been a few weeks since renewables in Spain hit a significant record level of output. The past few weeks have seen sustained high penetration levels of solar power generation in the country: It is still very unclear what caused it. The most we have so part is Portugal's grid operator blaming an 'atmospheric phenomenon' in Spain. Spain's grid operator hasn't said anything, at the time of writing. But that hasn't stopped a wide range of people doing exactly what we expect them to: blaming renewable energy.\n\nRenew Economy 29th April 2025 read more \"\n\nSpain is one of the countries at the forefront of efforts to rely more on renewable electricity as part of the shift away from fossil fuels, but Monday's crisis is likely to stoke concerns about power networks' ability to meet the added demand and increased volatility of supply from renewables. Elaborating on the possible cause of the blackout, Sánchez said: \"At 12:33 this morning, 15GW of generation were suddenly lost from the system and they were lost in just five seconds. This is something that has never happened before. 15GW is equivalent to approximately 60% of the country's demand at that time. Weather data showed that the temperatures over southern Spain had risen sharply between midday and 1pm local time. Higher temperatures can limit how much electricity cables can carry. However, Stephen Jarvis, an assistant professor in environmental economics at LSE, said the weather had not been abnormal and a system failure was the likelier culprit, as supply and demand became mismatched.\n\nFT 28th April 2025 read more \"\n\nLights flickered back to life across most of Spain and Portugal on Tuesday after a massive blackout hit the Iberian peninsula, stranding passengers in trains and elevators while millions lost phone and internet coverage. Electricity had been restored to nearly 90% of mainland Spain by early on Tuesday, the grid operator REE said. Power was restored overnight to around 6.2m households in Portugal out of 6.5m, according to the national electricity grid operator. Lights also came on again in Madrid and in Portugal's capital, Lisbon. Barely a corner of the peninsula, which has a joint population of almost 60 million people, escaped the blackout. But no firm cause for the shutdown has yet emerged.\n\nGuardian 28th April 2025 read more \"\n\nA reliance on net zero energy left Spain and Portugal vulnerable to the mass blackouts engulfing the region, experts said on Monday night. In what is believed to be Europe's largest power cut, tens of millions of people were left without electricity, while flights were grounded, trains halted and whole cities were left without power, internet access or other vital services. The cause of the initial fault in the region's electricity grid is still being investigated, and the EU has insisted that there were no indications that it was a cyberattack. However, energy experts have blamed a heavy reliance on solar and wind farms in Spain for leaving the region's power grid vulnerable to such a crisis.\n\nTelegraph 28th April 2025 read more \"\n\nWhat exactly caused the massive power cuts that swept Spain, Portugal and parts of southern France? That is the question on the lips of every energy expert in Europe - and theories abound. Spanish authorities suggested they were investigating the possibility of a cyber attack on grid infrastructure, while some officials in Portugal initially said it was caused by a freak weather phenomenon before backtracking. Both say the exact cause is still unknown. At the same time, others have warned that Spain's growing reliance on renewable energy, particularly solar power, may also have contributed to the crisis.\n\nThe operators of Spain's nuclear reactors are preparing to reconnect to the power grid as they recover their external electricity supply, the country's nuclear safety council said on Monday. The only exception is the Trillo plant, which is shut down for refueling, it said. The nuclear safety council had said earlier that the reactors were in safe condition after a power blackout hit the country. Four reactors stopped operating automatically after the outage, after which emergency generators kicked in.\n\nReuters 28th April 2025 read more \"\n\nA frantic search is on to figure out what, exactly, caused Spain and Portugal to lose power on Monday, leaving millions of people without access to basic modern necessities. The answer will have serious ramifications for the two countries -- and for Europe as a whole. The EU has been pressing the Iberian Peninsula, which has long operated as an energy island within the bloc, to link up better to Europe's grids. Already on Monday, specialists were debating whether such connections could have helped prevent the massive blackouts -- or put more countries at risk of experiencing spillover effects. Spain and Portugal are champions of green energy in the EU, and were sourcing over 80 percent of their electricity from renewables just before the outage hit on Monday. Experts have previously said that the rapid expansion of wind and solar power is putting increased pressure on the Spanish grid, which is in need of an upgrade to handle record volumes of intermittent renewables. But green energy was not to blame for Monday's blackout, Meeus said, since the EU has in recent years enforced several sets of rules, like updated grid connection codes from 2016, to prevent renewable power generators from disconnecting from the network in a way that endangers the system.\n\nPolitico 28th April 2025 read more \"\n\nSome analysts have suggested that the Spanish grid operator's reliance on renewable energy sources to supply the majority of the nation's electricity could have led to the blackout. Traditional generators, like coal and hydroelectric plants or gas turbines, are connected directly to the grid via heavy spinning machines. When turned on, these massive machines are in constant motion and the inertia created by their weight and momentum acts like a shock absorber, helping to insulate the grid against a sudden disturbance - for example, in the event of a transmission failure. Solar and wind power do not provide the natural inertia generated by these so-called 'spinning machines', leaving the grid more vulnerable to disruptions and subsequent oscillations in the electrical frequency.",

                            "body": "Tony Blair has warned the western policies to tackle global climate change are \"failing\" and demanded that it is time for a radical reset to win over hearts and minds on the issue.\n\nThe major intervention by the former prime minister is torpedoes current net zero policies and calls for the COP process to be torn down and replaced.\n\nIt is a shot across the bows of the current Labour government and energy secretary Ed Miliband's much criticised policies on pushing headlong towards renewables.\n\nMr Miliband was already facing an onslaught in the wake of the government having to intervene to save British Steel with critics claiming his policies had almost brought it closure by causing soring energy prices.\n\nWriting the foreword for his own think tank's new paper, The Climate Paradox: Why We Need to Reset Action on Climate Change, Sir Tony has warned that there is a widening credibility gap with voters who are \"being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know that their impact on global emissions is minimal.\"\n\nThe intervention could not come at a more sensitive time for Sir Keir Starmer's government which is facing local elections in 48 hours, a first serious electoral test since the general election.\n\nIt follows months of attacks on Mr Miliband for closing down Britain's fossil fuel capacity in coal mines and oil and gas from the North Sea as well as pushing for massive new green energy installations such as solar panel farms and wind farms.\n\nIn particular Nigel Farage's Reform have capitalised in stealing Labour votes with an anti-Net Zero policy platform.\n\nAdded to that it coincides with a new assault on Starmer's policies on workers rights and a flatlining economy coming under attack from the British Retail Consortium, the CBI and think tanks.\n\nSir Tony endorses the paper authored by the Tony Blair Institute (TBI)'s director of climate and energy policy Lindy Fursman, which calls for the COP international series of conferences to be dismantled, while a \"new coalition\" must be built to act.\n\nIt claims that COP is struggling to \"deliver change at the speed required\" and must evolve to match ambition with delivery.\n\nIn his foreword, Sir Tony argues that while climate activism has succeeded in raising awareness, today's policy strategies have become disconnected from political, public, and economic reality, and the debate is \"riven with irrationality\". The result is a widening credibility gap between climate policy and climate delivery.\n\n\"Activists have shifted the political centre of gravity on climate,\" he said, but \"the movement now needs a public mandate - attainable only through a shift from protest to pragmatic policy.\"\n\nHighlighting a cycle that pushes proposals but delivers little real progress on global emissions, he wrote that \"political leaders by and large know that the debate has become irrational\" but are \"terrified of saying so, for fear of being accused of being 'climate deniers.'\"\n\nMeanwhile, voters \"feel they're being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know that their impact on global emissions is minimal.\"\n\nSir Tony pointed to global trends that undermine today's climate approach: fossil fuel use is set to rise further up to 2030, airline travel is to double over the next 20 years, and by 2030, almost two-thirds of emissions will come from China, India, and Southeast Asia.\n\nThese are \"inconvenient facts\" he says, that mean that \"any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging COP's role in scaling ambition, Sir Tony said that \"the process will not deliver change at the speed required\":\n\n\"The great gathering of all the nations has its place - though probably not every year. But the reality is it is the decisions of the large countries, and the policy direction they give towards the technology and the financial flows, which can in truth solve the climate issue.\"\n\nHe proposes a new model which must evolve to match ambition with delivery: \"We now need a new process that scales global solutions. A new cooperative approach to technological Instead of eliminating emissions with green energy and electric cars, the papers urges governments to prioritise global investment in carbon capture - investing in solutions that capture emissions at source before they reach the atmosphere, together with breakthrough technologies like direct air capture that permanently remove carbon.\n\nThe TBI also wants them to harness the power of technology, including AI - decarbonising smarter and faster, technology can turbocharge the path to net zero, from smarter tech delivering lower bills, to better systems and faster progress.\n\nIt argues that AI applied to energy efficiency and the better use of the energy grid is potentially revolutionary in reducing energy demand.\n\nThere is also a call to invest in frontier energy solutions - including new generation nuclear and fusion technologies. The papers argue that small modular reactors offer hope but need integration into energy strategy. Scaling up means less pollution, more jobs and new abundant energy sources that don't fuel the climate crisis.\n\nThe TBI also wants Starmer's government and others to scale up nature-based solutions - from planting forests to developing carbon-smart crops, we must harness the power of nature and science together. They argue that nature is one of our best allies in this fight, and we need to back it with smart science and innovation.",

Valued at Rs. 2,981.06 crore, this public offering comprises a fresh issue of Rs. 2,626.30 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of ₹354.76 crore. Even though the company has a strong position in the electric two-wheeler market, the current Grey Market Premium (GMP) stands flat, raising questions about the IPO's immediate appeal.\n\nAther Energy IPO GMP Today\n\nAs per the latest data from Investorgain, the Ather Energy IPO GMP (Grey Market Premium) stands at Rs. 0 as of April 28, 2025, 07:55 AM. The IPO price band has been fixed between Rs.304 and Rs. 321 per share. Based on the current GMP, the estimated listing price for Ather Energy shares is Rs. 321, indicating an expected gain or loss of 0.00% per share. With no visible premium in the grey market, investor sentiment remains cautious, and market participants are closely monitoring the Ather Energy IPO subscription status and bidding trends over the next few days.\n\nAther Energy IPO Details\n\nThe Ather Energy IPO is a book-building public issue aggregating to Rs.2,981.06 crore. The IPO aims to raise funds through a combination of a fresh issue and an offer for sale (OFS). The fresh issue consists of 8.18 crore equity shares, amounting to Rs.2,626.30 crore.

Expert View\n\nFor Ather Energy IPO, expert opinions are divided. SBI Securities recommends investors to avoid subscribing to the IPO, highlighting key concerns such as the company's inability to achieve profitability at both EBITDA and PAT levels. They also point out the intensifying competition in the electric two-wheeler segment from major players like TVS Motors, Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, and the newly launched Honda Activa EV.\n\nAdditionally, SBI Securities mentions that at the upper price band of Rs.321, Ather Energy IPO valuation stands at 5.7 times its Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio, making it an expensive proposition based on its current financials.\n\nTheir verdict is clear: \"Investors are recommended to AVOID the issue. We will review the company's performance post listing.\"\n\nAbout Ather Energy\n\n\"Ather Energy Ltd. is a leading pure-play electric vehicle (EV) company in India, specialising in electric two-wheelers (E2Ws) and offering an integrated ecosystem that includes proprietary charging infrastructure (Ather Grid), smart accessories, and its in-house developed software platform (Atherstack).

                            "body": "Thousands of deaths per year in the UK may be linked to the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs), analysis suggests.\n\nExperts behind the research said they believe there is a relationship between people eating UPFs and an increased risk of early death.\n\nUPFs have been linked previously to poor health, including to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease, cancer and early death.\n\nExamples of UPFs include ice cream, processed meats, crisps, mass-produced bread, some breakfast cereals, biscuits and fizzy drinks.\n\nUPFs often contain high levels of saturated fat, salt, sugar and additives, which experts say leaves less room in people's diets for more nutritious foods.\n\nUPFs also tend to include additives and ingredients that are not used when people cook from scratch, such as preservatives, emulsifiers and artificial colours and flavours.\n\nHowever, some experts say it is not clear why UPFs are linked to poor health and question whether this is because of processing or because people are opting for foods high in fat, sugar and salt rather than more nutritious options.\n\nIn the new study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, experts call on governments to issue dietary recommendations aimed at cutting consumption of UPFs.\n\nThey looked at data from eight countries around the world and found UPFs reached 53% of people's energy intake in the UK - the second highest in the study after 55% in the US.\n\nPremature deaths attributable to UPFs ranged from 4% of premature deaths in lower consumption settings, such as Colombia, up to 14% of premature deaths in the UK and US, according to their mathematical modelling.\n\nThe researchers suggested that in 2018/19, some 17,781 premature deaths in the UK could have been linked to UPFs, according to their model.\n\nLead investigator of the study Eduardo Nilson, from the scientific body the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Brazil, said: \"UPFs affect health beyond the individual impact of high content of critical nutrients (sodium, trans fats, and sugar) because of the changes in the foods during industrial processing and the use of artificial ingredients, including colourants, artificial flavours and sweeteners, emulsifiers, and many other additives and processing aids, so assessing deaths from all causes associated with UPF consumption allows an overall estimate of the effect of industrial food processing on health.\"\n\nDr Nilson said the study found \"each 10% increase in the participation of UPFs in the diet increases the risk of death from all causes by 3%\".\n\nStephen Burgess, statistician in the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge, said the study was observational and could not prove cause.\n\n\"This type of research cannot prove that consumption of ultra-processed foods is harmful, but it does provide evidence linking consumption with poorer health outcomes,\" he said.\n\n\"It is possible that the true causal risk factor is not ultra-processed foods, but a related risk factor such as better physical fitness - and ultra-processed foods is simply an innocent bystander.\n\n\"But when we see these associations replicated across many countries and cultures, it raises suspicion that ultra-processed foods may be more than a bystander.\"\n\nNerys Astbury, associate professor from the University of Oxford, said it is known that consuming diets higher in calories, fat and sugar can have detrimental effects on health, including premature mortality.\n\n\"This study adds to the body of evidence on the association between UPF and ill health and disease,\" Dr Astbury added.\n\n\"However, many UPF tend to be high in these nutrients, and studies to date have been unable to determine with certainty whether the effects of UPF are independent of the already established effects of diets high in foods which are energy dense and contain large amounts of fat and sugar.\n\n\"The authors of the study conclude that advice to reduce UPF consumption should be included in national dietary guideline recommendations and in public policies.\n\n\"However, rushing to add recommendations on UPF to these recommendations is not warranted based on this study in my opinion.\"\n\nShe said the Nova system, which defines foods according to different levels of food processing, \"has many limitations, including arbitrary definitions and overly broad food categories...\".\n\nShe added: \"More research is needed to ascertain a causal link between UPF and disease and to establish the mechanisms involved.\"",

                            "title": "China tops global ranking of overall nuclear power capacity, report says",
                            "body": "China is set to become a global leader in operational nuclear power capacity by 2030, as it is steadily expanding its nuclear energy industry, said experts and company executives.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, the country had 102 nuclear reactors in operation, under construction, or approved for construction, with a combined installed capacity of 113 million kilowatts, according to the \"China Nuclear Energy Development Report 2025\", which was released on Sunday in Beijing at the Spring International Forum on Sustainable Nuclear Energy Development.\n\nThis is the first time that China's overall nuclear power capacity has topped global rankings, the report said.\n\n\"China's nuclear energy development is entering a new period of strategic opportunities,\" Yang Changli, rotating chairman of the China Nuclear Energy Association, said at the forum.\n\n\"By 2030, the installed capacity of operational nuclear power is expected to reach 110 million kW. Nuclear power will play a vital role as a key substitute for high-carbon energy sources and a mainstay for the stability of the new power system,\" Yang said.\n\nOn Sunday, the State Council, China's Cabinet, approved the construction of 10 new reactors, including Phase III of the Sanmen Nuclear Power Plant in East China's Zhejiang province, with a combined investment exceeding 200 billion yuan ($27.4 billion).\n\nThis is the fourth year in a row that China has approved at least 10 new reactors, which further demonstrates the key role that nuclear power plays in the country's clean energy transition.\n\nAccording to the CNEA, China currently has 28 nuclear reactors under construction, with a total installed capacity of 33.65 million kW. It also has 58 operational commercial nuclear reactors, with a combined installed capacity of 60.96 million kW.\n\n\"China's nuclear power sector has entered a peak period of large-scale construction,\" said Dong Baotong, vice-minister of ecology and environment. \"With more units expected to be approved in the future, China's scale of units under construction is higher than the combined total of units under construction in countries worldwide.\"\n\nAccording to the report, investment in nuclear power engineering construction in 2024 reached a record high of 146.9 billion yuan, about 52 billion yuan more than the previous year.\n\nCITIC Securities estimated that with the accelerated approval of nuclear power projects, investment in new nuclear power plants in China is expected to reach 231 billion yuan by 2025, which will further stimulate the country's related industry chain and help the country achieve its carbon emission reduction targets sooner than planned.\n\nSafety prioritized\n\nThe State Council meeting on Sunday emphasized absolute safety in nuclear power development, calling for efforts to ensure that nuclear power units are built and operated in accordance with the highest global safety standards.\n\nAccording to the latest World Association of Nuclear Operators' index on global nuclear power unit performance, China's nuclear power operation safety performance has continued to rank among the best in the world.\n\nHou Yingdong, an official with the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said at a news conference on Wednesday that China's nuclear power units have been operating with good safety standards for years.\n\nNuclear power units on the Chinese mainland have been operating safely for over 600 reactor years, he said. A reactor year refers to an operating year of one nuclear reactor.\n\nHou noted that China's nuclear power plants are all located far from earthquake-prone areas, and the impact of natural disasters such as heavy rain, floods and tsunamis has been fully considered. \"The safety of the nuclear power plants is guaranteed in the face of extreme natural disasters,\" he said.\n\nChina has also established the world's largest monitoring network for radiation environment quality, and the radiation environment level around nuclear facilities has remained good for years, according to the news conference.\n\nTech independence\n\nThe China Nuclear Energy Association said that by 2024, China had achieved 100 percent domestic origin for key main equipment for nuclear power and ensured the independent control of key component technologies. It added that the country's independent research and development in the sector continues to achieve new breakthroughs.\n\nThe National Energy Administration said earlier that China has been making steady progress on under-construction nuclear power projects, and future power supply growth is likely to come mostly from nonfossil energy sources amid the country's green transition.\n\nAccording to China General Nuclear Power Corp, which will operate four of the 10 newly approved reactors, the four reactors will use China's domestically designed Hualong One technology.\n\nHualong One is China's third-generation nuclear power technology with full intellectual property rights. It is also one of the most widely accepted series of third-generation nuclear power reactors in the world.\n\nHualong One is the most-used third-generation nuclear power technology in terms of units in operation or under construction worldwide, showing China's leading role in nuclear power technology and its overall competitiveness in the sector, according to CGN.\n\nAfter the approval of the 10 new units, the total number of Hualong One nuclear power units in operation or under construction, both domestically and internationally, has reached 41, it said.",

                            "body": "While a comprehensive investigation will take weeks to complete, today's massive power outages across Spain and Portugal present compelling evidence of the inherent vulnerability in renewable-heavy grids and likely offer a stark lesson in the dangers of sacrificing grid stability on the altar of green energy. While officials scramble to restore power to millions and politicians inevitably deflect blame, the catastrophic failure aligns perfectly with warnings that power grid experts have been sounding for years: systems with high penetrations of solar and wind generation have diminished mechanical inertia and are inherently vulnerable to collapse.\n\nSpain's electrical grid, once a model of reliability, has undergone a radical transformation over the past decade. Conventional power plants with massive spinning turbines - the kind that naturally resist frequency changes and provide crucial stability - have been systematically replaced with weather-dependent solar panels and wind turbines that contribute virtually no inertia to the system.\n\nThe result? A grid that may function adequately under ideal conditions but remains perilously susceptible to rapid destabilization when faced with disturbances.\n\nAnatomy of a collapse\n\nInitial reports from Spain grid operator Red Eléctrica indicate that 'oscillations' in the network triggered the cascade of failures. This technical language obscures a simpler truth: the system likely lacked sufficient physical inertia to withstand a relatively routine disturbance.\n\nThe data reveals the shocking speed and scale of the collapse. Real-time generation data shows that before the blackout, Spain's grid was operating with an extremely renewables-heavy mix, including 18,068 MW from solar PV (by far the largest contributor at approximately 54% of domestic generation) and 3,643 MW from wind. By contrast, conventional synchronous generation sources provided minimal output: nuclear at 3,388 MW, hydro at 3,171 MW, and combined cycle at just 1,633 MW.\n\nAfter the collapse, the generation mix shifted dramatically as operators struggled to restore the system. Total demand dropped from ~27 GW to just ~16 GW. Interestingly, nuclear generation disappeared completely from the generation stack, confirming that these plants - typically considered the most reliable part of the generation fleet - were forced to disconnect entirely during the event. Solar PV output fell by more than half to 8,236 MW, while other sources like wind and hydro saw similar reductions.\n\nWhat is system inertia and why does it matter?\n\nSystem inertia is the inherent resistance to sudden frequency changes provided by the kinetic energy stored in rotating masses of conventional power plants. When a disturbance occurs, this inertia automatically slows the rate of frequency change, giving operators crucial seconds to respond. Consider the difference between a heavily ballasted ship and a lightweight vessel in rough seas. The former can absorb massive waves without capsizing, while the latter remains dangerously vulnerable to sudden squalls.\n\nPower system engineers have been warning about the high penetration of renewables and the inertia-related risk for years. The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) has been sounding increasingly urgent alarms about declining system inertia. Their studies methodically demonstrate that as renewable generation increases, the reduction in rotating mass weakens the grid's natural ability to resist frequency disturbances and they've identified a critical vulnerability: when renewable generation dominates the mix, the resulting low rotating mass and insufficient inertia create conditions where frequency disturbances can accelerate rapidly - precisely the pre-failure conditions that existed in Spain's grid before today's collapse. Indeed, these conditions mirror the vulnerabilities observed in previous European events, such as the 2021 Iberian Peninsula separation.",

The destroyer is equipped with supersonic strategic cruise missiles, tactical ballistic missiles and other strike means.\n\nNorth Korea conducted a test-firing of supersonic cruise missiles, strategic cruise missiles, anti-aircraft missiles and 127 millimeter ship-based automatic guns Monday, the KCNA said. A test of firing ship-to-ship tactical guided weapons, the ship's automatic guns, smoke and electronic jamming guns took place the following day.\n\nThe North's leader stressed the need to \"perfect\" the warship's weapons systems for integrated operations in a short span of time.\n\n\"It is important to establish a proactive and offensive defensive system on the premise of powerful attack capability,\" Kim was quoted as saying by the KCNA.\n\n\"The time has come to make a responsible option for accelerating the nuclear armament of the navy in order to defend the state and maritime sovereignty from the existing and future threat,\" the North's leader said, setting forth unspecified tasks for accomplishing such a goal.\n\nNorth Korea has focused on strengthening its naval power in an effort to build a platform capable of delivering nuclear attacks from the sea.\n\nAt last week's launching ceremony, Kim called for building more warships of \"Choe Hyon class\" and larger cruisers, as well as various types of escort ships, next year and also developing \"nuclear-powered submarines\" in the future.\n\nIn March, the North unveiled what appears to be a nuclear-powered submarine under construction, with its leader warning that his country's maritime defense capability will be \"fully\" projected \"in any necessary waters without limitation.\"",

                            "body": "🎉 Celebrating 15 years with you, we're updating our look and feel! Please excuse any disruptions as we bring our site up to date for an even better experience.\n\nBy Damilola Ogunbiyi, CEO and Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All, and Co-Chair of UN-Energy\n\nEnergy access is a fundamental driver of economic growth. However, Africa faces a daunting challenge - approximately 600 million people continue to live in energy poverty, while one billion lack access to clean cooking solutions. At the same time, estimates place the Black population at 1% of the energy workforce. Projections indicate that Africa's energy demand will more than triple by 2040. This surge in demand, coupled with the current energy deficits, necessitates urgent interventions. The critical question for Africa and much of the developing world is how to provide more energy but lower emissions.\n\nSustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) is an international organization hosted by the United Nations Office for Project Service (UNOPS), with a global mandate to accelerate progress on the energy transition in emerging and developing countries. The organisation collaborates with governments and partners worldwide to end energy poverty, accelerate the deployment of renewable energy solutions, and combat climate change.\n\nThe SEforALL analysis, conducted in 2024, aims to understand the scale of the challenge and identify the urgency required to meet global energy targets. This analysis builds on the latest data from the Tracking SDG7: The Energy Progress Report 2024, providing a snapshot of the world's current situation across the four targets of SDG7: electricity access, clean cooking access, renewable energy, and energy efficiency.\n\nOur analysis shows that if we do not urgently raise ambition, the number of people in Africa without electricity access may stay the same by 2030. If we are to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) by 2030, we must provide electricity access to 157 million people per year and increase clean cooking access for 334 million people each year.\n\nHowever, despite the scale of action needed, there are examples of leadership that are already thriving on the continent. Countries such as Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda are on track for full electricity access by 2030, offering inspiration to other countries.\n\nGhana has invested significantly in renewable energy sources, particularly solar power. Kenya has focused on diversifying its energy mix with investments in geothermal, wind, and solar power. Rwanda is increasing energy access through innovative approaches and government commitment.\n\nAfrica's capacity for renewable energy potential is huge but remains unrealized. The continent holds 60% of the world's best solar resources yet accounts for just 1% of installed solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity. Currently, sub-Saharan Africa relies heavily on diesel and petrol generators, with customers spending nearly $20 billion annually on fuel alone. This reliance is costly and unsustainable.\n\nSeveral initiatives are underway to boost Africa's renewable energy resources, but it is critical that this be done in a way that creates opportunities for local communities, and general economic prosperity for countries. One of the most ambitious initiatives that is trying to boost the clean energy economy in Africa is Mission 300, spearheaded by the World Bank Group and the African Development Bank working together with SEforALL, the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), and The Rockefeller Foundation. This initiative aims to provide electricity access to 300 million people in Africa by 2030.\n\nBy utilizing Africa's abundant renewable resources, Mission 300 aims to create a sustainable and resilient energy infrastructure that can support economic growth and improve the quality of life for millions of people.\n\nOne of the key components of Mission 300 is the development and implementation of National Energy Compacts. These compacts outline bold commitments and the critical actions needed to advance energy access in a reliable, affordable, and sustainable manner. The initiative will be supported by innovative financing mechanisms, bringing public, private and philanthropic capital together to support the implementation of Mission 300.\n\nAfrica's demand for power is projected to grow eight-fold by 2050. Renewables are expected to meet much of this demand, creating a significant market opportunity for establishing local green manufacturing hubs. SEforALL forecasts that by 2030, up to 14 million energy transition jobs could be created in Africa. The energy transition could offer the means for bringing in equity in the global energy markets, a philosophy that we are guided by in our work on green industrialisation across developing countries.\n\nSEforALL is also a key partner of the Global Africa Business Initiative (GABI), which is playing a key role in advancing energy access and the energy transition across Africa. Annually, GABI's 'Unstoppable Africa' event in New York engages the world in conversations that truly matter, focusing on critical issues such as energy access and energy transition. GABI aims to bridge the gap between Africa's vast renewable energy potential and its current energy deficits by encouraging investment in renewable energy projects and supporting policies that facilitate the growth of this sector.\n\nBy encouraging investment in energy-transition technologies, GABI aims to create jobs, improve healthcare and education, enhance digital inclusivity, and boost overall economic productivity. Through these efforts, GABI is positioning Africa as a key player in the global energy landscape and paving the way for a more sustainable future.\n\nThe energy transition is already underway in Africa, but we must accelerate it. We know the scale of what needs to be done. We have the solutions. Now, we must act! This is Africa's moment to power its future -- sustainably, equitably, and at scale.",

Its construction was agreed during a visit by President Vladimir Putin to North Korea in 2024.\n\nRussia's Kommersant newspaper said the bridge will be ready by the summer of 2026.\n\nMishustin said the bridge \"will allow entrepreneurs to significantly increase transportation volumes and reduce transportation costs, ensure reliable and stable supplies of various products, which will contribute to the expansion of trade and economic cooperation,\" TASS reported.\n\nAbout 600 North Korean troops have been killed fighting for Russia against Ukraine out of a total deployment of 15,000, South Korean lawmakers said on Wednesday, citing the country's intelligence agency.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters; Writing by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Andrew Osborn)",

                            "body": "Amid 25% hike in power bills, Pakistanis rush to adopt solar energy as a cost-saving alternative.\n\nAmid the sweltering 40-degree heat that gripped Karachi in April, entrepreneur Saad Saleem ran his air-conditioning without hesitation.\n\nDespite a sharp rise in electricity tariffs, Saleem remained unaffected, having earlier invested $7,500 to install solar panels on the roof of his bungalow -- part of a broader solar energy boom taking place across Pakistan.\n\nSaleem bought his modules two years ago, as the International Monetary Fund and economically beleaguered Pakistan were hammering out a preliminary bailout program. Under the deal, Pakistan sharply raised power and gas tariffs to support struggling suppliers in the heavily indebted sector.\n\nPakistanis now pay more than a quarter more on average for electricity, setting off a scramble to install solar modules.\n\nSolar made up over 14 percent of Pakistan's power supply last year, up from 4 percent in 2021 and displacing coal as the third-largest energy source, according to UK energy think-tank Ember. That is nearly double the share in China, the world's top supplier of solar panels and a global leader in green technologies, and one of the highest rates in Asia, according to Reuters' analysis of Ember data.\n\nBut the explosion in solar uptake has left out many in Pakistan's struggling urban middle class, who have been forced to cut back on electricity in face of soaring bills, according to interviews with more than two dozen people, including energy officials, consumers and power-sector analysts. Most of the nation's solar panels aren't connected to sell excess capacity to the grid, so the benefits of cheap and reliable power aren't widely shared.\n\nThe flight of affluent Pakistanis with solar access from the national grid has dealt a further blow to those relying on pricey conventional sources of power. Electricity companies that lost their most lucrative clients have been forced to additionally hike prices on their shrinking pool of customers to cover operating costs, according to Arzachel, a Karachi-based energy consultancy.\n\nSome observers also blame financial stress in the energy sector on deals Pakistan made with China for Beijing to finance billions of dollars' worth of power-generation contracts, many of which involve coal-fired plants. Pakistan is behind on many of the payments and has been in talks with China about extending the time it has to repay the debt.\n\nCountries like South Africa also face widening energy gaps after affluent residents adopted solar power. But analysts are watching Pakistan particularly closely due to the pace at which the nation of 250 million has taken to sun-based energy.\n\n\"This could serve as a cautionary tale as to how regulation and policy needs to keep up with technological change and rapidly evolving economics,\" said Haneea Isaad, an Islamabad-based energy finance specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Pakistan power minister Awais Leghari acknowledged the energy gap but noted that tariffs have come down significantly since June 2024, when the IMF approved reductions.\n\nHe also pointed to heavy uptake of solar by rural Pakistanis, many of whom previously had limited access to the grid. Many non-urban Pakistanis have installed small solar setups to meet their power needs, which are typically far lower than those of their city-dwelling counterparts.\n\n\"Pakistan has actually gone through a solar revolution,\" he said. \"The grid is going to get cleaner by the day, and this is something that we've achieved as a nation that we are proud of.\"\n\nJust a few miles away from Saleem's upscale neighborhood, Nadia Khan has restructured her life to cut electricity costs.\n\nThe air-conditioning in the homemaker's apartment is rarely used and she's stopped ironing most of the clothes worn by her family of five, citing the price of power.\n\nKhan's family is not alone in cutting back: Only 1 percent of paying consumers used over 400 units of power in 2024, per Karachi-based consultancy Renewables First, down from 10 percent before the pandemic.\n\nLike others among Pakistan's masses of apartment dwellers without space to install solar modules, Khan has been shut out of the revolution.\n\nThe roofs of many apartment buildings are designated for water storage and other sanitation purposes, while owners of rental buildings have little incentive to invest in solar connections for their tenants.\n\n\"We get some sunlight indoors but I can't seem to think of a way to go solar,\" she said. \"Why must people living in apartments suffer?\"\n\nMeanwhile, land-owning Pakistanis have benefited from the glut of Chinese-made low-cost solar modules shut out of the West by high tariffs.\n\nChina exported 16.6 gigawatts of solar capacity to Pakistan last year, according to Ember, about five times as much as in 2022. The average cost per watt of solar-module capacity exported also fell 54 percent in the same period.\n\nHowever, most solar setups aren't configured to send spare power back to the grid, limiting their benefit to the wider public. Renewables expert Syed Faizan Ali Shah, who advises the government on solar adoption, has said that less than 10 percent of solar consumers sell excess power to the grid.\n\nExperts and government officials blame high costs and sanctioning delays. Connecting a solar module to the grid usually takes between three and nine months, said Renewables First energy expert Ahtasam Ahmad, prompting many to not bother.\n\nConverting power generated from a solar panel for transmission to the grid also requires equipment like inverters, which typically cost between $1,400 and $1,800, or roughly half the median household income in Pakistan.\n\nSUNK COSTS\n\nPakistan conglomerate Interloop has installed hundreds of solar modules next to its cowsheds in Punjab province that help provide the electricity keeping its 9,300 livestock cool and their milk chilled.\n\nThe investment in solar has been a lucrative one for Interloop, which typically breaks even on solar installation costs after three to four years. Basic operating costs are about three quarters less than payments to the grid, said Interloop energy manager Faizan Ul Haq.\n\nThe money Interloop saves also reflects a gaping hole in the accounts of Pakistan's power companies.\n\nEven though industrial groups and wealthier Pakistanis now consume less grid power, suppliers' costs haven't changed proportionately. Fixed expenses like fuel contracts and upgrades to transmission architecture accounted for about 70 percent of supplier expenditure in the year to June 2024, according to an Arzachel estimate.\n\nTo cover costs, suppliers have raised prices on their remaining customers, who have already faced repeated increases as a result of the IMF deal.\n\nFixed costs of 200 billion rupees were shifted to non-solar consumers in the 2023-2024 fiscal year, meaning they paid 6.3 percent more per kilowatt-hour than they otherwise would have, according to Arzachel data.\n\nSolar panel imports have increased since, meaning grid demand is likely to continue dropping, forcing remaining customers to pay more.\n\n\"Pakistan's experience demonstrates a crucial lesson: when governments fail to adapt quickly enough, people take charge,\" said Ahmad of Renewables First.",

                            "body": "HUNDREDS of thousands of energy customers need to act now to avoid being cut off in just a months' time.\n\nHouseholds with Radio Teleswitch Service (RTS) meters need to switch to a smart meter before June 30 this year, when the service will be switched off.\n\nHundreds of thousands of customers on Economy 7 and other multi-rate energy tariffs use these meters, which charge customers cheaper rates depending on the time of day.\n\nThis means that anyone who does not swap to a smart meter could find their heating or hot water does not work properly.\n\nAround 530,000 households need to upgrade from an RTS meter, according to the most recent figures from Energy UK.\n\nSuppliers have been urging customers to switch to a smart meter before the deadline.\n\nThey have been individually contacting their customers to book a smart meter installation appointment.\n\nHere we explain what each of the suppliers have said and what you need to do.\n\nThe energy supplier has revealed to The Sun that around 41,000 RTS meters still need to be replaced before the June deadline.\n\nOctopus is contacting customers to book a meter exchange.\n\nThe energy giant said that roughly half of the affected customers have already booked an appointment to upgrade their meter.\n\nBut this leaves approximately 20,500 households that have not yet taken action.\n\nYou can book a smart meter installation in your online account.\n\nThe major energy firm has urged 65,000 customers with RTS meters to take action to avoid being cut off.\n\nRamona Vlasiu, chief operating officer at E.ON Next, told The Sun: \"It is vitally important for customers with RTS meters to respond to us to ensure their meter is upgraded before the radio signal is switched off from June 30.\n\n\"We have engineers available to upgrade your meter to ensure your supply is not affected.\"\n\nYou can book a smart meter appointment online at eonnext.com/smart.\n\nEDF has warned its customers with an RTS meter to get in touch with the supplier.\n\nThe provider told The Sun: \"The Radio Teleswitch Signal (RTS) switch-off date of 30 June 2025 is fast approaching and some customers may not realise they have an RTS meter that needs changing.\"\n\nThey added that if your home is supplied by an older style meter then it is important to check if it is controlled by a Radio Teleswitch.\n\nSo if you have installed a gas supply, or your peak and off-peak rates are billed together then you could still be affected.\n\nThey added: \"If you have an RTS meter that's not changed by June 2025, it could have an impact on your heating, hot water and how much you pay for your energy, so it's important that your meter is exchanged as soon as possible.\"\n\nIt is easy to tell if your meter is an RTS one.\n\nThe oldest RTS-powered meters have a switch box labelled \"Radio Teleswitch\" located next to the electric meter.\n\nOthers may have the RTS switch box within the electric meter as a single box on the wall.\n\nOne way to tell is if you get cheaper energy at different times of the day.\n\nYou may be on a tariff called Economy 7, Economy 10 or Total Heat Total Control.\n\nAnother way to tell is if your home is heated using electricity or storage heaters, according to Energy UK.\n\nRTS meters are also often used in areas with no gas supply, for example with high rise flats or houses in rural areas.\n\nIf your home is in one of these locations then it is worth checking your meter.\n\nIf you are still unsure then contact your supplier and ask if you have RTS equipment.\n\nThey should be able to tell you if you have one.\n\nIf you have one of these meters then you should book a smart meter installation as soon as you can.\n\nA recent investigation by The Sun found that many suppliers are facing a shortage of appointments.\n\nThe delays are partly due to the high number of RTS customers who are rushing to upgrade to a smart meter.\n\nSmart meters have the same features as RTS meters and can record different prices at different times of the day, which are offered by Economy 7 tariffs.\n\nThey use a digital signal and can show your energy usage in real time, which can help you to save money.\n\nSmart meters are being rolled out by suppliers across the UK and so far around 36million households have one.\n\nBut millions of households have one that does not work.\n\nAround one in ten smart meters are thought to have gone dumb, according to industry regulator Ofgem.\n\nSome customers have said that their smart meter monitor has a broken display or it will not connect to the network.\n\nMeanwhile, many first-generation smart meters have outdated technology, which should not be an issue with ones fitted now.\n\nSuppliers should fix smart meters that are not working but you will need to take meter readings in the meantime to make sure your bills are accurate.\n\nMonitors that show your readings and usage should be replaced or fixed for free.\n\nYou can ask your supplier for a traditional meter but they are not obliged to give you one as smart meters are being phased in to replace them.\n\nOfgem has told suppliers that they must take reasonable steps to ensure that you are given a like-for-like tariff when switching to a smart meter.\n\nIn cases where this is not possible they should work with the customer to agree an appropriate tariff.\n\nThere are more smart meter-only tariffs than RTS ones and many of them will save you money.\n\nIf you have not received a letter from your supplier yet then you do not need to wait until you receive one.\n\nYou can contact your supplier directly to book an appointment.",

                            "body": "The pilot of the Black Hawk helicopter that collided with the American Airlines passenger airplane did not comply with directions to change course seconds before the fatal incident, a bombshell new report has revealed. On the night of January 29, Army Black Hawk pilot Capt. Rebecca Lobach (pictured) was conducting an annual flight evaluation with her co-pilot Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, who was serving as her flight instructor.\n\nThree months on, new details published by The New York Times revealed that the pilot made more than one mistake leading to one of the worst catastrophes in aviation history. Not only was Lobach flying her Black Hawk too high, but in the final moments before the impact, she failed to take advice and instruction from her co-pilot to switch course. Lobach's piloting skills were being tested during the evaluation on the fateful night, before the crew were informed that an aircraft was nearby, according to the report.\n\nJust 15 seconds before colliding with the commercial airplane, air traffic control told Lobach and Eaves (Pictured) to turn left, but she did not do so. Seconds before impact, co-pilot Eaves then turned to Lobach in the cockpit and told her that air traffic control wanted her to turn left. She still did not do so. Investigators may never know why Lobach did not change course that day. Both Lobach and Eaves had first acknowledged the message that an aircraft was nearby, and spotted the plane themselves before requesting to fly by 'visual separation.'\n\nThis is a practice that allows aircraft to avoid collisions based on their own observations instead of following the air traffic controller's instructions. 'The request to fly under those rules is granted routinely in airspace overseen by controllers. Most of the time, visual separation is executed without note. 'But when mishandled, it can also create a deadly risk -- one that aviation experts have warned about for years,' aviation experts told the outlet.\n\nThe report stated: 'The Black Hawk was 15 seconds away from crossing paths with the jet. Warrant Officer Eaves then turned his attention to Captain Lobach (pictured). He told her he believed that air traffic control wanted them to turn left, toward the east river bank.' If she had turned left, it 'would have opened up more space between the helicopter and Flight 5342,' it added. Instead, 67 people - everyone aboard the plane and helicopter - perished. Lobach, from Durham, North Carolina, was an aviation officer in the Army and had racked up around 500 hours of flying time. She also served as a White House military social aide during the Biden administration. A critical rule in the industry is that if two aircraft are on a collision course pilots have to be advised if they are likely to merge, according to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. Experts found that did not happen that night and that 'immediate intervention was needed' to prevent the horrible tragedy that left 67 dead.\n\n'Direct, immediate intervention was needed that night. Instead of seeing and avoiding Flight 5342, Captain Lobach continued flying straight at it,' the report read. Though it remains unclear why Lobach defied orders, Aviation experts predict she may have been 'blindsided' that the American Airlines flight was 'circling' Runway 33 that night. Investigators now believe the Black Hawk crew did not hear the word 'circling' because they might have been pressing the microphone key to talk at the same time the crucial term came through, according to the report. 'If the key is depressed, the pilot can speak but not hear incoming communications,' it detailed.\n\nThere is also no indication that Lobach suffered a medical emergency at the time of the crash, and didn't have pre existing health issues, her loved ones and people close to the investigation told the outlet. In February it was revealed that the helicopter crew may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, investigators said. NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said the recording from the Black Hawk suggested an incomplete radio transmission may have left them without understanding how it should shift position to avoid the aircraft. 'That transmission was interrupted - it was stepped on,' she said, leaving them unable to hear the words 'pass behind the' because the helicopter's microphone key was pressed at the same moment. 'At 8:47:42 - or 17 seconds before impact - a radio transmission from the tower was audible on both CVRs directing the Black Hawk to pass behind the CRJ,' Homendy told reporters. 'CVR data from the Black Hawk indicated that the portion of the transmission that stated 'pass behind the' may not have been received by the Black Hawk crew.'\n\nHomendy said the helicopter was on a 'check' flight that night where the pilot was undergoing an annual test and a test on using night vision goggles. Investigators believe the crew was wearing night vision goggles throughout the flight and that there was nothing to suggest that the crew had removed them. Just before that discovery, it was revealed that vital tracking technology inside the helicopter was turned off for 'no compelling reason' when it collided. When the chopper went down, the Black Hawk's Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast was disabled - a system which shares an aircraft's position, altitude and speed, Sen. Ted Cruz previously told The New York Times.\n\nThe technology also includes a display that shows pilots the location of other aircraft both in the sky or on a runway, and allows air traffic controllers to not just rely on radar tracking - which could have a delay of a few seconds. The American Airlines jet, which was flying from Wichita, Kansas, and preparing to land at the time of the crash, was piloted by 34-year-old Jonathan Campos, whose relatives said had dreamed of flying since he was three. The passenger plane recorded its altitude at 313 feet two seconds before collision.\n\nA few minutes before the twin-engine jet was to land, air traffic controllers asked if it could use a shorter runway. The pilots agreed, and flight-tracking sites show the plane adjusted its approach. The jet's passengers ranged from a group of hunters to students and parents from northern Virginia schools to members of the Skating Club of Boston. They were returning from a development camp for elite junior skaters that followed the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

                            "body": "The plan, the product of more than a year of experimentation at this huge training range in Bavaria and other U.S. bases, draws heavily on lessons from the war in Ukraine, where small unmanned aircraft used in large numbers have transformed the battlefield.\n\nThe Army's 10 active-duty divisions would shift heavily into unmanned aircraft if the plan is carried out, using them for surveillance, to move supplies and to carry out attacks.\n\nTo glean the lessons from Ukraine's war against Russia, U.S. officers have debriefed its military personnel and consulted contractors who have worked with the Kyiv's military about their innovative use of drones.\n\n\"We've got to learn how to use drones, how to fight with them, how to scale them, produce them, and employ them in our fights so we can see beyond line of sight,\" said Col. Donald Neal, the commander of the U.S. 2nd Cavalry Regiment. \"We've always had drones since I've been in the Army, but it has been very few.\"\n\nDrones have transformed battlefields because they are cheap and can attack in swarms to overwhelm defenses.Staff officers with 2nd Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment work out of the back of a truck at Hohenfels, Germany.\n\nThe effort to integrate drones was on full display in February when a brigade from the 10th Mountain Division battled against a mock opponent here. During the Cold War, the huge Hohenfels training range was used to prepare for armored warfare against a potential Soviet attack on Western Europe.\n\nBut in an updated scenario reflecting new combat tactics used in Ukraine, small drones buzzed in the gray winter skies controlled by soldiers and defense contractors in the muddy fields below.\n\nThe bitter cold caused ice to form on some of the aircraft's rotor blades and sapped the batteries, a glitch that hadn't arisen in earlier exercises in Hawaii and Louisiana. Soldiers rushed to recharge them as they sought to keep the unmanned aircraft aloft.\n\nUkrainian and Russian troops have clashed with artillery, armored vehicles, manned fighters and other conventional systems. But it is drones that have transformed the conflict because they are cheap, can attack in swarms to overwhelm defenses, and can send live video feeds to the rear that can make it difficult to hide on the battlefield, analysts said.\n\n\"Land warfare has transitioned to drone warfare. If you can be seen, you can be killed,\" said Jack Keane, the retired general who served as vice chief of staff of the Army and observed the exercise here. \"A soldier carrying a rocket-propelled grenade, a tank, command and control facilities, artillery position can all be taken out by drones very rapidly.\"\n\nDrones are just one capability the Army plans to field as the Army seeks to buttress its ability to deter Russia and China after decades of fighting insurgencies in the Middle East and Central Asia.\n\nThe service is also developing ways to better link soldiers on the battlefield, drawing on cellphones, tablets and internet technology, and is acquiring a new infantry squad vehicle. The Army plans to invest about $3 billion to develop better systems for shooting down enemy drones and is moving to build up its electronic warfare capabilities.\n\nAltogether the overhaul would cost $36 billion over the next five years, officials said, which the Army would come up with by cutting some outmoded weapons and retiring other systems -- steps that will require congressional support.\n\nA soldier holds a drone during a U.S. Army training exercise in Hohenfels, Germany.The Army plan, which is intended to boost the service's capabilities in Asia and Europe, still envisions acquiring new tanks, long-range missiles, tilt-rotor aircraft and other conventional systems.\n\nThe \"Army Transformation Initiative,\" as the service's blueprint is known, comes as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has been seeking to slash spending and personnel across the government.\n\nGen. Randy George, the Army chief of staff, and Daniel Driscoll, the secretary of the Army, met with Vice President JD Vance recently to explain that the service had a plan to upgrade its capabilities while making offsetting cuts, a Pentagon official said. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth endorsed the plan in a directive signed this week.\n\n\"We aren't going to ask for more money,\" George said in an interview. \"What we want to do is spend the money that we have better.\"\n\nThe Army is halting procurement of Humvees, its main utility vehicle for decades, and will no longer purchase its Joint Light Tactical Vehicle. It is also stopping procurement of the M10 light tank, which has proven heavier and less useful than planned when the program began a decade ago. It is also planning to retire some older Apache attack helicopters. A reduction in civilian personnel will also contribute to the savings.\n\nGen. Randy George (left), Army chief of staff, inspects a drone.\n\nThree brigades -- the 3,000 to 5,000 soldier formations that make up divisions -- have already been outfitted with some of the new unmanned systems, and the goal is to transform the rest of the active duty force within two years, Driscoll said in an interview. A division typically has three brigades.\n\nArmy divisions that haven't begun to incorporate the new technology typically have about a dozen long-range surveillance drones, which were first deployed more than a decade ago.\n\nThe Marines have done away with their tanks as part of a separate overhaul that calls for small missile-toting combat teams to hop from island to island in the Western Pacific to attack the Chinese fleet in a conflict.\n\nThe Army plan, which is intended to boost the service's capabilities in Asia as well as Europe, still envisions acquiring new tanks, long-range missiles, tilt-rotor aircraft and other conventional systems.\n\nThe American industrial base will have to increase to produce the latest off-the-shelf technology that the Army wants. Last year, Ukraine built more than two million drones, often with Chinese components, U.S. officials say. But the U.S. military isn't allowed to use parts from China.\n\nTwo soldiers observe a drone at the U.S. Army's Hohenfels Training Area.\n\nWrite to Michael R. Gordon at michael.gordon@wsj.com",

The Expedition 73 crew is also preparing for a spacewalk on Thursday to ready the orbital outpost for a new rollout solar array and relocate a communications antenna.\n\nNumerous experiments exploring how blood pressure, eyes, and cells are affected by microgravity packed the schedule aboard the International Space Station on Monday. Scientists will take the unique data and pursue advanced therapies promoting healthy humans on and off the Earth.\n\nBlood pressure checks awaited NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers on Monday for the CIPHER suite of 14 human research investigations. Ayers began her shift scanning McClain's chest with the Ultrasound 2 device while electrodes measured her blood pressure. Doctors are observing the arterial structure and function of astronauts to assess the cardiovascular risk of living and working in space.\n\nMcClain later installed research hardware inside the Veggie space botany facility for the Advanced Plant Experiment-12 space botany study that will observe how space radiation affects plant genetics. Ayers then peered into medical imaging gear with assistance from NASA astronaut Jonny Kim so researchers could get a glimpse of her optic nerve to identify potential space-caused eye health issues.\n\nKim also set up physics research hardware inside the Destiny laboratory module's Microgravity Science Glovebox for the Colloidal Solids experiment that may benefit the pharmaceutical, food, and personal care industries on Earth. The upcoming investigation will observe how soft solids, such as gels, respond to weightlessness and may lead to the design of new materials.\n\nMcClain and Ayers are also preparing to exit the space station on Thursday for a six-hour and 35-minute spacewalk. The pair spent an hour on Monday reviewing the steps necessary in the vacuum of space to install a rollout solar array modification kit on the station's port side truss structure and relocate an antenna that communicates with visiting vehicles. This will be McClain's third spacewalk, Ayers first, and the 275th in space station program history.\n\nStation Commander Takuya Onishi of JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) split his day between exploring how cells sense gravity and installing hardware containing biological fluid samples. He first relocated cell samples from an incubator into a microscope to observe the mechanism that enables cells to sense the effects of gravity. Results from the Cell Gravisensing investigation may lead to therapies treating space-caused and Earthbound muscle and bone conditions. Onishi then installed cassettes containing fluid samples in the Advanced Space Experiment Processor-4, a research facility that can be shipped back and forth from Earth to space, for the biotechnology study. That investigation may further research and commercialization opportunities in space.\n\nRoscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov set up Earth observation gear and activated a camera to photograph landmarks in Canada and western Africa. Cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky took a hearing test on Monday inside the Quest airlock using specialized audiometric hardware that eliminates the need to isolate oneself in a soundproof booth. The pair would spend the rest of the day on a variety of electronics and life support maintenance.\n\nLearn more about station activities by following the space station blog, @space_station and @ISS_Research on X, as well as the ISS Facebook and ISS Instagram accounts.\n\nGet the latest from NASA delivered every week.

                            "body": "By Stephanie Kelly\n\nNEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Monday issued an emergency waiver to allow the sale of a higher-ethanol gasoline blend to be sold this summer nationwide, saying it will add to fuel supply during the peak U.S. driving season and bring down costs.\n\nThe move likely will benefit biofuel producers and corn farmers, as it is expected to expand the market for their products. Both industries have pushed for nationwide year-round sales of the higher-ethanol blend, which is called E15, as it is made up of 15% ethanol.\n\n\"This move to allow the summer sale of E15 will provide immediate relief to consumers, provide more choices at the pump, and drive demand for corn grown, processed, and used right here in America,\" U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said.\n\nThe government currently restricts sales of E15 gasoline in summer months due to environmental concerns over smog, which the biofuel industry says are unfounded.\n\nThe emergency waiver will go into effect on May 1. The Environmental Protection Agency, which issued the waiver, said it expects to extend the waiver until it no longer deems it necessary. The EPA has issued similar waivers for the summer in recent years.\n\n\"With geopolitical conflict roiling energy markets worldwide, we applaud President Trump and Administrator (Lee) Zeldin for acting quickly to combat potential fuel shortages and help keep a lid on gas prices this summer,\" said Geoff Cooper, president of the Renewable Fuels Association, a biofuels trade group.\n\nEarlier this year, the EPA said it would uphold an April 28 implementation date for a request from governors in Midwestern states to allow year-round sales of E15.\n\nIn Monday's action, the EPA said it waived provisions that would have otherwise made E10 gasoline sold in the states of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin meet a more stringent standard than conventional gasoline in other areas of the country.

                            "body": "ESA's groundbreaking Biomass satellite, designed to provide unprecedented insights into the world's forests and their crucial role in Earth's carbon cycle, has been launched. The satellite lifted off aboard a Vega-C rocket from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, on 29 April at 11:15 CEST (06:15 local time).\n\nLess than an hour after launch, Biomass separated from the rocket's upper stage. At 12:27 CEST, the satellite controllers at ESA's European Space Operations Centre in Germany received the all-important first signal, relayed via the Troll ground station in Antarctica, that Biomass is working as expected in orbit.\n\nControllers will spend the coming days carrying out the 'launch and early orbit' phase, meticulously verifying that all systems are functioning correctly.\n\nThis critical phase also involves a series of intricate manoeuvres to deploy the satellite's 12-metre-wide mesh reflector supported by a 7.5-metre boom. Once this phase is complete, Biomass will join the portfolio of pioneering missions operated from ESA's mission control centre.\n\nCarrying the first P-band synthetic aperture radar in space, the Biomass mission is designed to deliver crucial information about the state of our forests and how they are changing, and to further our knowledge of the role forests play in the carbon cycle.\n\nESA's Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonetta Cheli, said, \"I'd like to extend my congratulations to everyone who has been involved in developing and launching this extraordinary mission. Biomass now joins our esteemed family of Earth Explorers - missions that have consistently delivered groundbreaking discoveries and advanced scientific understanding of our planet.\n\n\"With Biomass, we are poised to gain vital new data on how much carbon is stored in the world's forests, helping to fill key gaps in our knowledge of the carbon cycle and, ultimately, Earth's climate system.\"\n\nForests play a vital role in Earth's carbon cycle by absorbing and storing large amounts of carbon dioxide, helping to regulate the planet's temperature. Often called 'Earth's green lungs', they absorb around 8 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. However, deforestation and degradation - especially in tropical regions - are releasing stored carbon back into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.\n\nA major challenge for scientists and policymakers is the lack of accurate data on how much carbon forests store and how these stocks are changing owing to factors such as rising temperatures, increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and human-driven land-use changes.\n\nBiomass is the first satellite equipped with a P-band synthetic aperture radar, which is capable of penetrating forest canopies to measure woody biomass - trunks, branches, and stems - where most forest carbon is stored. These measurements act as a proxy for carbon storage, the assessment of which is the mission's primary goal.\n\nData from Biomass will significantly reduce uncertainties in carbon stock and flux estimates, including those related to land-use change, forest loss, and regrowth.\n\nAbout Biomass\n\nESA's Biomass forest mission uses advanced space technology to provide new data on forests and their changes. It enhances our understanding of forests' roles in the carbon cycle and climate. Its P-band radar penetrates clouds and forest layers, scattering signals off forest elements. These signals reveal details like forest biomass and height. Biomass data will improve knowledge of habitat loss and its effects on biodiversity. The mission also enables the mapping of subsurface geology in deserts, ice sheet structures, and forest floor topography.\n\nThe satellite was developed by over 50 companies led by Airbus UK.\n\nAbout Vega-C\n\nEurope's Vega-C rocket can launch up to 3300 kg into space, including small scientific and Earth observation satellites. At 35 m tall, Vega-C weighs 210 tonnes on the launch pad and reaches orbit with three solid-propellant-powered stages before the fourth liquid-propellant stage takes over for precise placement of satellites into their desired orbit around Earth. Vega-C is the evolution of the Vega family of rockets and delivers increased performance, greater payload volume and improved competitiveness\n\nhttps://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Videos/2025/04/Lifting_the_canopy_on_Earth_s_forests",

                            "title": "Is China Set to Dominate the Future of Fusion Energy?",
                            "body": "The vacuum chamber at the Comprehensive Research Facility for Fusion Technology in Hefei, China, is just one of several fusion reactors under construction in the country.\n\nIn the rocky terrain of China's Sichuan province, a massive X-shaped building is quickly rising, its crisscrossed arms stretching outward in a bold, futuristic design. From a satellite's view, it could be just another ambitious megaproject in a country known for building fast and thinking big. But to some observers of Chinese tech development, it's yet more evidence that China may be on the verge of pulling ahead in one of the most consequential technological races of our time: the quest to achieve commercial nuclear fusion.\n\nFusion -- the process that powers stars -- promises nearly limitless clean energy, without the radioactive waste and meltdown risk of fission. But building a reactor that can sustain fusion requires an extraordinary level of scientific and engineering precision.\n\nThe X-shaped facility under construction in Mianyang, Sichuan, appears to be a massive laser-based fusion facility; its four long arms, likely laser bays, could focus intense energy on a central chamber. Analysts who've examined satellite imagery and procurement records say it resembles the U.S. National Ignition Facility (NIF), but is significantly larger. Others have speculated that it could be a massive Z-pinch machine -- a fusion-capable device that uses an extremely powerful electrical current to compress plasma into a narrow, dense column.\n\n\"Even if China is not ahead right now,\" says Decker Eveleth, an analyst at the research nonprofit CAN Corp., \"when you look at how quickly they build things, and the financial willpower to build these facilities at scale, the trajectory is not favorable for the U.S.\"\n\nFusion is a marathon, not a sprint -- and China is pacing itself to win.\n\nOther Chinese plasma physics programs have also been gathering momentum. In January, researchers at the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) -- nicknamed the \"Artificial Sun\" -- reported maintaining plasma at over 100 million degrees Celsius for more than 17 minutes. (A tokamak is a donut-shaped device that uses magnetic fields to confine plasma for nuclear fusion.) Operational since 2006, EAST is based in Hefei, in Anhui province, and serves as a testbed for technologies that will feed into next-generation fusion reactors.\n\nNot far from EAST, the Chinese government is building the Comprehensive Research Facility for Fusion Technology (CRAFT), a 40-hectare complex that will develop the underlying engineering for future fusion machines. Results from EAST and CRAFT will feed into the design of the China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR), envisioned as a critical bridge between experimental and commercial fusion power. The engineering design of CFETR was completed in 2020 and calls for using high-temperature superconducting magnets to scale up what machines like EAST have begun.\n\nMeanwhile, on Yaohu Science Island in Nanchang, in central China, the federal government is preparing to launch Xinghuo -- the world's first fusion-fission hybrid power plant. Slated for grid connection by 2030, the reactor will use high-energy neutrons from fusion reactions to trigger fission in surrounding materials, boosting overall energy output and potentially reducing long-lived radioactive waste. Xinghuo aims to generate 100 megawatts of continuous electricity, enough to power approximately 83,000 U.S.-size homes.\n\nWhy such an aggressive push? Fusion energy aligns neatly with three of China's top priorities: securing domestic energy, reducing carbon emissions, and winning the future of high technology -- a pillar of President Xi Jinping's \"great rejuvenation\" agenda.\n\n\"Fusion is a next-generation energy technology,\" says Jimmy Goodrich, a senior advisor for technology analysis at RAND. \"Whoever masters it will gain enormous advantages -- economically, strategically, and from a national security perspective.\"\n\nThe lengthy development required to commercialize fusion also aligns with China's political economy. Fusion requires patient capital. The Chinese government doesn't need to answer to voters or shareholders, and so it's uniquely suited to fund fusion R&D and wait for a payoff that may take decades.\n\nIn the United States, by contrast, fusion momentum has shifted away from government-funded projects to private companies like Helion, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, and TAE Technologies. These fusion startups have captured billions in venture capital, riding a wave of interest from tech billionaires hoping to power, among other things, the datacenters of an AI-driven future. But that model has vulnerabilities. If demand for energy-hungry data centers slows or market sentiment turns, funding could dry up quickly.\n\n\"The future of fusion may come down to which investment model proves more resilient,\" says Goodrich. \"If there's a slowdown in AI or data center demand, U.S. [fusion] startups could see funding evaporate. In contrast, Chinese fusion firms are unlikely to face the same risk, as sustained government support can shield them from market turbulence.\"\n\nThe talent equation is shifting, too. In March, plasma physicist Chang Liu left the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory to join a fusion program at Peking University, where he'd earned his undergraduate degree. At the Princeton lab, Liu had pioneered a promising method to reduce the impact of damaging runaway electrons in tokamak plasmas.\n\n\"The future of fusion may come down to which investment model proves more resilient.\" -- Jimmy Goodrich, RAND\n\nLiu's move exemplifies a broader trend, says Goodrich. \"When the Chinese government prioritizes a sector for development, a surge of financing and incentives quickly follows,\" he says. \"For respected scientists and engineers in the U.S. or Europe, the chance to [move to China to] see their ideas industrialized and commercialized can be a powerful draw.\"\n\nMeanwhile, China is growing its own talent. Universities and labs in Hefei, Mianyang, and Nanchang are training a generation of physicists and engineers to lead in fusion science. Within a decade, China could have a vast, self-sustaining pipeline of experts.\n\nThe scale and ambition of China's fusion effort is hard to miss. Analysts say the facility in Mianyang could be 50 percent larger than NIF, which in 2022 became the first fusion energy project to achieve scientific breakeven -- producing 3.15 megajoules of energy from a 2.05-megajoule input.\n\nThere are military implications as well. Eveleth notes that while the Mianyang project could aid energy research, it also will boost China's ability to simulate nuclear weapons tests. \"Whether it's a laser fusion facility or a Z-pinch machine, you're looking at a pretty significant increase in Chinese capability to conduct miniaturized weapons experiments and boost their understanding of various materials used within weapons,\" says Eveleth.\n\nThese new facilities are likely to surpass U.S. capabilities for certain kinds of weapons development, Eveleth warns. While Los Alamos and other U.S. national labs are aging, China is building fresh and installing the latest technologies in shiny new buildings.\n\nThe United States still leads in scientific creativity and startup diversity, but the U.S. fusion effort remains comparatively fragmented. During the Biden administration, the U.S. government invested about $800 million annually in fusion research. China, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, is investing up to $1.5 billion per year -- although some analysts say that the amount could be twice as high.\n\nFusion is a marathon, not a sprint -- and China is pacing itself to win. Backed by a coordinated national strategy, generous funding, and a rapidly expanding talent base, Beijing isn't just chasing fusion energy -- it's positioning itself to dominate the field.\n\n\"It's a Renaissance moment for advanced energy in China,\" says Goodrich, who contends that unless the United States ramps up public investment and support, it may soon find itself looking eastward at the future of fusion. The next few years will be decisive, he and others say. Reactors are rising. Scientists are relocating. Timelines are tightening. Whichever nation first harnesses practical fusion energy won't just light up cities. It may also reshape the balance of global power.",

                            "title": "Ireland extremely unlikely to hit offshore energy targets by 2032",
                            "body": "There is just a 10% chance Ireland's offshore energy targets for 2030 will be hit by 2032, and it's 'plausible' there will be no new developments by the start of the next decade, Extra.ie can reveal.\n\nThe warning is contained in an internal briefing document for the then-environment minister Eamon Ryan last December, prior to him being replaced by Darragh O'Brien a month later.\n\nThe Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has said Ireland could face fines of between €8 billion and € 26 billion for failing to meet its emissions targets by 2030. That is potentially twice as much as the State received after the € 13 billion Apple tax windfall in 2024.\n\nAs other countries in the EU are struggling to meet their goals, Ireland will be more exposed to fines, as there will be fewer options to purchase energy credits from countries that are exceeding their targets.\n\nIt comes as the Government's climate action ambition was dealt a blow last week after plans to build 30 turbines off the coasts of counties Clare and Galway were abandoned.\n\nThe project received 177 objections, including one from comedian and TV host Tommy Tiernan, who did so 'on the grounds of desecration of that area of natural beauty'.\n\nThe internal documents obtained by Extra.ie, under the Freedom of Information Act, were prepared for Mr Ryan and contain a summary of expert opinions compiled as part of the Decarbonised Electricity System Study by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.\n\nIt surveyed 30 experts and said offshore development 'is considered very uncertain over both the long and short terms', with a 'best guess' of 1.4 gigawatts (GW) deployed by 2030 and 8.8 GW deployed by 2040.\n\n'There is a 10% chance Ireland could reach the 5GW 2030 target by 2032,' the briefing note said.\n\nOnshore wind has proven to be more reliable, with the experts saying it has 'comparatively more certainty than offshore wind and solar', with a best guess of 7.1 GW by 2030. However, the experts are still doubtful that the 2030 targets in this area will be hit.\n\n'There is a 10% chance Ireland could reach the 9 GW 2030 target by 2031,' the officials wrote.\n\nThey describe solar power as having 'more certainty than offshore wind, but less than onshore' with a best guess of 6.3 GW by 2030 and 11.6 GW by 2040.\n\n'There is a 10% chance Ireland could reach the 8 GW 2030 target by 2030. However, experts expect five-fold growth, from about 2.5 GW in 2025 to 11.6 GW in 2040,' they wrote.\n\nThe experts recommended short-term measures (up to 2027) that 'must be implemented to achieve the high-growth forecasts for renewables', such as changes to planning and maritime laws.\n\nSome of these are already being done. For example, Mr O'Brien got Cabinet approval for a national Designated Maritime Area Plan (DMAP) for offshore energy, recommended in the plan, that will designate sites capable of delivering at least 15 GW by 2040.\n\nThe Government is also introducing changes to planning legislation to impose time limits on decisions for 'national strategic infrastructure' and to restrict who can take judicial reviews.\n\nThe experts urged the Government to host another Offshore Renewable Electricity Support Scheme to boost capacity at An Bord Pleanála and the National Parks and Wildlife Service for processing applications. They also warned against stricter wind farm rules, particularly around noise.\n\nThe experts warned that reliance on green hydrogen as a fuel for electricity generation before 2040 is considered a 'high-risk strategy'.\n\nSpeaking on Newstalk, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said there needs to be a 'relentless' focus on progressing wind farms and that local councils had blocked progress for too long.\n\n'There's been moves where development plans were sent out, mainly for political reasons, to say: \"We don't want any of this.\" And they're constructed in such a way so there can never be a wind farm again,' he said.\n\nPublic Expenditure Minister Jack Chambers echoed this last week, announcing a new Infrastructure Division and taskforce to speed up delivery. He warned that the public good was being 'undermined by people trying to frustrate progress'.\n\nSpeaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, the chairman of the Energy and Climate Action Committee at the Irish Academy of Engineering, Eamonn O'Reilly, warned we will not meet our targets out to 2050.\n\nHe said the commitment in the Climate Action Plan 2021 to be carbon neutral in 2050 is 'wishful thinking', as it is planning on the basis of technology that 'doesn't exist' yet.\n\nHe said Mr O'Brien was right to seek to advance floating offshore energy, despite it being 'unproven', but added that targets need to be 'realistic'.",

                            "body": "There has been a lot attention given to hydrogen in the past years both in the policy arena and within the energy industry, indeed the term \"hydrogen-hype\" has been used. This has introduced some noise into an otherwise constructive, but at the same time divided, discussion. Divided yes, because now as we sit in the first half of 2025 there is no clear path for the use of hydrogen in our future energy system. Indeed, there are many who argue that green hydrogen would be used extensively across the economy, whilst others question the economics of the whole ecosystem, and at the same time many others disqualify technologies that are widely accepted in many parts of Europe, such as the blending of natural gas with hydrogen.\n\nIn the short term, green hydrogen is not be the cure-all for the energy crisis, it is not a silver bullet but in the long term it will be indispensable in the fight against climate change.\n\nHydrogen is the talk of the town with the European Commission with many other countries making it a big priority in their industrial strategies. Green is the new black!\n\nAre we about to enter the golden age for hydrogen or is just another false dawn for the molecule?\n\nNow as we continue into 2025 we are witnessing a sobering of the hydrogen market. Questions arise, has Hydrogen moved to a position of beyond the peak of inflated expectations? Has the hydrogen market seen a period of overcorrection?\n\nHydrogen generated by electrolysis is the best link between physical energy from renewable sources and chemical energy. Will hydrogen in its elemental form ever become a dominating energy carrier?\n\nThe question of whether hydrogen is a \"hype\" or \"hope\" is a complex and debated topic that depends on various factors, including technological advancements, market dynamics, and policy support.\n\nSo, is the focus on hydrogen, with decarbonization and energy security front and centre in the global energy vision, all just wishful thinking (hope) or bravado (hype)? The 'hydrogen economy' has been gaining significant attention in recent years, with many experts and industry leaders touting it as a game-changer in the transition to a low-carbon economy. However, the question remains: is hydrogen a hype, a hope, or a slow burner?\n\nHydrogen is the topic of the day. The much heralded global 'Hydrogen Revolution' has prompted many politicians from across the world to follow the hydrogen bandwagon and to follow suit without questioning the promises of the hydrogen enthusiasts. The hydrogen economy has indeed garnered significant attention in recent years, with proponents advocating for its potential to play a crucial role in the transition to a low-carbon economy. However, critics continue to raise concerns about the industry's ability to deliver on its promises, citing instances of projects failing to meet expectations. To provide a balanced assessment, it is essential to examine the current state of the hydrogen industry, its challenges, and its potential.\n\nOn the one hand, hydrogen has several advantages that make it an attractive alternative to traditional fossil fuels. It is a clean-burning fuel that produces only water and heat as by products, making it an ideal solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, hydrogen can be produced from renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, which can help to decarbonize the energy sector. Furthermore, hydrogen can be used as a fuel for transportation, power generation, and industrial processes, making it a versatile energy carrier.\n\nOn the other hand, there are several challenges that the hydrogen industry needs to overcome before it can realize its full potential. One of the primary concerns is the high cost of producing, storing, and transporting hydrogen. Currently, the majority of hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels, which undermines its environmental benefits. Moreover, the infrastructure for hydrogen production, storage, and transportation is still in its infancy, which limits its widespread adoption.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are several reasons to believe that hydrogen is not just a hype, but a slow burner with significant potential. Firstly, governments and industries are investing heavily in hydrogen research and development, which is driving innovation and reducing costs. For instance, the European Union has set ambitious targets to increase the use of hydrogen in its energy mix, and several countries, such as Japan and South Korea, are actively promoting the development of hydrogen fuel cell technology.\n\nSecondly, there are already several successful hydrogen projects around the world that demonstrate its potential. For example, the city of Fukuoka in Japan has been operating a hydrogen fuel cell bus system since 2019, which has reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality. Similarly, the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands is exploring the use of hydrogen as a fuel for ships, which could significantly reduce emissions from the maritime sector.\n\nA transition to a hydrogen economy would be a sea change in our energy infrastructure and is generating significant debate as to the fit, timing and indeed even need for the technology. As an energy carrier, hydrogen is being compared to electricity, with some stating that in our journey to net zero it is the only widespread and possibly viable alternative\n\nWhen hydrogen is employed to transmit renewable electricity, only ~50% can reach the end user in a power-to-power arrangement due to 'round-trip' losses incurred from hydrogen production (via electrolysis), hydrogen compression and transport, and fuel cell conversion of hydrogen back to power. Many are stating that the current 'rush' into a hydrogen economy is neither supported by energy efficiency arguments nor justified with respect to economy or ecology. In fact, it appears that hydrogen will not play an important role in a sustainable energy economy because this 'energy carrier' cannot be more efficient than the energy from which it is made. Renewable electricity is better distributed by electrons than by hydrogen.\n\nThe opposite may be true. Because of the much-cited efficiency wastefulness of a hydrogen economy, the promotion of hydrogen at all costs may counteract other reasonable measures of energy conservation. Even worse, the forced transition to a hydrogen economy may prevent the establishment of a sustainable energy economy based on an intelligent use of precious renewable resources.\n\nThis paper is positioned to elicit debate from all sides of the green molecule discussion and to direct attention to some fundamental problems of a hydrogen economy. The perception of hydrogen as either \"hype\" or \"hope\" or \"slow burner\" is a matter of perspective (regional, national, and international). Yes: horses for courses, the low carbon future will look different in different places - one size does not fit all.\n\nGreen hydrogen has the potential to play a crucial role in decarbonizing sectors that are difficult to electrify directly, such as heavy industry, long-haul transportation, and certain types of heating. Hydrogen can act as a form of energy storage, complementing the variability of renewable energy to be captured and stored for later use, helping to stabilize grids and address intermittency issues. Hydrogen can also be used in a wide range of applications, from fuel cells for vehicles to industrial processes. Its versatility makes it a potentially valuable tool for achieving clean energy goals across various sectors.\n\nThere are many questions that need to be answered if we are to discern the gap between hype and hope in the hydrogen economy. It is agreed that more energy is needed to split water into hydrogen and oxygen than can ever be later retrieved from the generated hydrogen.\n\nThese questions need to be answered before investments are made in a hydrogen future. It will cost trillions of dollars to convert the entire energy system to hydrogen. Thus, it is simply due diligence to question the optimistic claims of the hydrogen promoters before tax money is spent on research, development and hardware. Any new energy technology must be based on a sound platform of science, engineering and economics.\n\nIn addressing the questions above we need to be mindful of the starting question in the debate. What are the current and future possible uses of hydrogen and what are their scale? How flexible could these uses be? The use of hydrogen to store electricity is inflexible, however what about steel making and providing high temperature industrial heat? If we can develop flexibility in the process, then it could lower whole system costs.\n\nSome critics argue that hydrogen has been overhyped as a solution to various global challenges, such as decarbonization and energy transition. They highlight the following concerns:\n\nHydrogen especially green hydrogen has real potential to:\n\n1. Fuel the energy transition away from fossil fuels\n\n4. Develop a balanced pathway for a just transition for all\n\nHydrogen can play a part in decarbonising certain sectors, including transport, as well as complementing the variability of renewables. However, it is essential that hydrogen production shifts towards clean methods (e.g. water electrolysis and other low-carbon techniques) rather than relying on hydrocarbons such as reformation of natural gas, as mainly occurs in 95% of production today.\n\nWe are an economy in transition, one where a fully-fledged clean energy sector is now being established, driven by both long-standing industry players and start-ups at the forefront of innovation. A new economy that can propel our industries to sustainable growth. Many proponents and supporters of low-carbon hydrogen see it as clean energy vector, a promising solution with significant potential to address key global challenges:\n\nMany countries are investing in hydrogen research and development, and there is a growing international interest in establishing a hydrogen economy. This collaboration could drive technological advancements and cost reductions over time. The past four years have witnessed a true surge in expectations about hydrogen and its possible use cases in the EU's decarbonisation, but the peak of inflated expectations is over by now, and because of emissions, cost and technical reasons the sector is coming off the clouds. Once this temporary disillusionment is over, there will be no other way to continue decarbonisation than to turn to hydrogen. But its large-scale use is going to come at a later stage than expected currently in the still hyped policy arena.\n\nIndustry advocates and policymakers worldwide have heralded hydrogen energy as the \"fuel of the future\". But, when you clear away the industry smoke screen, there are many reasons to be sceptical. On closer examination it's hard to see the hydrogen hype as anything other than a greenwashing effort from fossil fuel interests, especially in the case of 'blue' hydrogen (hydrocarbon production with the carbon by-product captured and stored). So-called hydrogen energy isn't an energy source, but rather an energy vector. Hydrogen \"energy\" is inherently inefficient, expensive, and whilst low-carbon hydrogen has low/zero emissions at point of production, other types of hydrogen such as grey hydrogen is emissions intensive. This hype will cost billions of dollars, with few, if any climate benefits to show for it.\n\nHydrogen technology has been used for limited purposes for many years now, but only recently has a global interest in the technology become more widespread. Water is bountiful in supply, and whilst it is resource-intensive to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, it is essentially an infinite resource. Hydrogen can be stored for long periods of time and has the potential to decarbonise the industrial energy sector and vastly improve replaced fossil fuels in heating buildings. Experts have also highlighted that vehicles driven by hydrogen fuel cells can be used along with electric vehicles to help decarbonise the transport sector and other hard to decarbonise sectors.\n\nLess than 1% of the global total annual hydrogen production is green (i.e., produced via electrolysis of water). Although hydrogen is the most common element in the Universe, energy is required to extract it from fossil fuels and water by breaking the chemical bonds that allow it to be released from carbon (in the case of methane) and oxygen (in the case of water). It is not energy efficient - round trip efficiencies for hydrogen production, treatment, storage, transport and power generation are around just 50%. This makes the production of hydrogen extremely expensive. What's more, research and innovation are needed to make hydrogen harnessing cheaper and more sustainable. Hydrogen's lower density means it needs to be stored and transported under high pressure, which is costly and carries safety risks.\n\nThe production of green hydrogen is also highly energy intensive and cannot compete without subsidies. No matter the colour, hydrogen is full of problems. It greenwashes and entrenches harmful industries like oil refining, fracking, and unsustainable fertilizer. And while there could be a few niches uses for hydrogen energy, there's are arguments against universal use. Cars and home heating don't need hydrogen and can be electrified.\n\nAs the hydrogen hype grows, we must be wary of industry claims. Before making any investments in hydrogen or issuing permits, governments must evaluate the full impact of hydrogen. That includes comparing it to the tools we already have to transition away from fossil fuels, such as electrification, energy efficiency, and clean renewable energy.\n\nGreen hydrogen is a catalyst for hope. It has real potential to play a significant role in fostering positive change and optimism for a more sustainable decarbonised, energy autonomous future. Green hydrogen goes beyond just being a clean energy vector delivering decarbonisation and enhanced energy storage. Green hydrogen delivers economic, environmental, and social versatility, from the creation of a new clean economy with job creation, enhanced innovation, and international collaboration opportunities.\n\nThe Paris Agreement has identified green hydrogen energy as an element of parts of possible solutions to meeting the worldwide zero-emissions target. Governments around the world are including hydrogen as part of their strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the versatility of hydrogen is attracting strong interest from a diverse range of governments and companies across the globe. Investments in hydrogen can generate a new clean energy economy that will in turn create new technological and industrial development in economies around the world, creating new industries, new career opportunities and developing cleaner greener economic policies and developments.\n\nGreen hydrogen is a clean energy vector, a key part of the EU's 'REPowerEU' plans and a pillar in the transition toward a decarbonized society. It has many advantages over traditional fossil energy due to its zero-carbon emission, high conversion efficiency, and high energy density. By 2050, hydrogen-based energy consumption could account for up to 20% of the world's final energy consumption and will reduce CO emissions by up to 80 gigatons, accounting for 20% of cumulative emission reductions. Moreover, hydrogen can outcompete or complement renewable energy in many applications. For example, green hydrogen can function as a storage medium of renewable-based electricity to stabilize the grid system. Regarding the construction industry, hydrogen-ready combined heat and power systems are more cost-competitive and efficiency-enhanced than other alternatives.\n\nOver 30 countries and regions have issued hydrogen strategies and roadmaps. These policies differ in orientation, scope, and scale and reflect a mix of green, blue and grey hydrogen.\n\nInterestingly five patterns of worldwide hydrogen energy development are as follows.\n\nThe transformation of our economies and societies to address the challenges of the climate and nature crisis are deeply political, will necessarily involve securing the voice and support of the democratic will and support of citizens and cannot be reduced to techno-fixes. Equally, given that the transformation of our societies means shifting to different types of societies, we must firmly, but gracefully, let go that our salvation lies in 'greening' or decarbonising 'business as usual'.\n\nThis is not particular to hydrogen, but we need to guard against dominant narratives that there is a technological solution to the crisis, and especially when such risky and empirically ungrounded views are coupled with narrow neoclassical models and understandings of economics. What is being focused on here is the risky and sub-optimal transformation pathways that will result from frankly mythic thinking about technologically 'decoupling' orthodox GDP economic growth (and associated patterns of globalisation, consumerism, including the current structure of our political economy under capitalism etc.).\n\nAs a recent report noted: \"Strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have so far focused primarily on increased energy and greenhouse gas efficiency to decouple resource use or emissions from economic growth. The scientific evidence for the effectiveness of this strategy is weak\"[1]. Therefore, if we are to fully appreciate the reality of the situation now facing humanity, and while not abandoning technological developments, hydrogen should be explicitly framed within the context of helping us move beyond 'greening business as usual'. This would not only be scientifically and social scientifically appropriate but would constitute a welcome and disruptive departure from technological innovations being in the service of the economic status quo, as defined by a narrow understanding of economics. What is meant by this is that the dominant understanding of economics and economic calculation that underlines everything from the Integrated Assessment Models of IPCC reports to cost-benefit calculations of climate action and energy transition options, to 'commonsense' thinking about economics from the boardroom to the bar room, is deeply problematic and producing risks.\n\nNeoclassical economics firstly is only one version of economics, there are others. It is largely ecologically ignorant, and its assumptions deeply disconnected from scientific principles of how the material world functions. But even more than that. Not only are there superior forms of economic thinking and analysis available (such as ecological/green political economy), but these are also much more 'fit for future purpose' in helping us navigate future energy and climate pathways.\n\nNeoclassical economics is anything but 'neutral', 'objective' or 'value-free', but rather (as all forms of political economy are) deeply ideological and normative. That is, neoclassical economics does not objectively describe how the 'economy' is, but prescribes how its 'ought' to be, namely a capitalist, growth oriented one. And so, what needs 'decoupling' is not capitalism and economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions and resource intensity via technological innovation, but rather the decoupling of technological innovations, such as green hydrogen, from capitalism and growth.\n\nHydrogen is not a \"slam dunk.\" Even the most ardent advocate, on closely examining the many challenges, will pause. Governments must develop a coordinated plan for introducing hydrogen that recognizes the nature of technology development, markets, and business investment.\n\nThere are recognised limitations of a hydrogen economy, the transition from fossil fuel-based energy economy to a hydrogen one is not a given. All losses within a hydrogen economy are directly related to the nature of hydrogen. Whilst these losses are significant at present, they can be reduced through use selection and research and development. We must accept that hydrogen is the lightest element, and its physical properties do not suit the requirements of all the applications of a clean energy market. It is not a question of hydrogen at any cost, it is a question of what and where hydrogen sits in a multitude of clean energy solutions as we tackle our use of, and the damage caused by fossil fuels. Current production, packaging, storage, transfer and hydrogen delivery techniques are so energy consuming, and in certain applications not sufficiently efficient, therefore other solutions must be investigated. We must identify certain benefits for this energy use, the market economy will always seek practical solutions and, as energy becomes more expensive, select the most energy-efficient of all options. In today's world, with a fossil fuel-based energy model, the envisaged hydrogen economy will never become a reality, we will only witness this when we devise a new energy model fit to drive a clean economy and recognise that the benefits of hydrogen will gradually become more important as energy transport, a storage medium and more as we measure these benefits on economic, environmental and social values.\n\nThe adoption and integration of hydrogen into existing energy systems is a complex pathway that will require significant technological advancements, infrastructure development, and policy support. These processes will take time, making hydrogen a \"slow burner\" in terms of its gradual and steady evolution rather than a rapid and immediate transformation. The challenges related to cost, efficiency, infrastructure, and market development contribute to this slow progression.\n\nHydrogen the unknown - the concept that hydrogen, despite its potential and various applications, still holds many uncertainties, challenges, and unexplored aspects. While hydrogen has gained attention as a potential solution for energy and sustainability challenges, there are several dimensions to its \"unknown\" nature. These are well documented and include, technical challenges, infrastructure development obstacles, economic viability, market dynamics, public acceptance, and integration challenges:\n\nWhile hydrogen holds great promise for addressing climate change, decarbonizing industries, and contributing to a sustainable energy future, it's important to acknowledge that its journey is still marked by various unknowns. Researchers, policymakers, industries, and the public are collectively navigating these uncertainties and working toward realizing hydrogen's potential while addressing its challenges.\n\nAt this point in time, it is not possible to say with certainty what the range and scale of hydrogen could and should be as an energy vector in a net-zero future, with many advocates and detractors providing competing views. This debate is ongoing in the UK, but the 'Future Energy Scenarios' published each year by Great Britain's electricity system operator, National Grid ESO, has afforded energy professionals a sober and reliable deep analysis of credible decarbonisation pathways to allow Britain to reach net-zero by 2050. Over the last 13 years, National Grid's annual 'FES' report has become a principal knowledge source for the energy industry.\n\nFES 2024 published in Summer 2024[2], has produced three net-zero pathways: 'Holistic Transition', 'Electric Engagement' and 'Hydrogen Evolution'. In each of the pathways identified, a role for hydrogen, in combination with electrification, is forecast to a greater (393TWh produced per annum) or lesser (142TWh/annum) extent. Industrial, commercial, and road, rail and aviation transport sectors are all identified as end users, with residential homes also forecast to receive hydrogen in the case of the 'Hydrogen Evolution pathway. Based on this analysis, we can say that hydrogen will have a crucial role to play in a net-zero future.\n\nIt is for this reason that the UK Government is supporting the development of low carbon hydrogen projects, with the Scottish Government also taking a leading role given the majority of the UK's wind energy resource is in Scotland - potentially resulting in a huge hydrogen export opportunity for Scotland, not dissimilar to the position of Ireland. In addition to a mutually supportive policy environment, the UK and Scottish Governments have implemented economic support schemes intended to accelerate the nascent hydrogen energy sector, which largely remains in the research and development, and demonstration phases. Key UK government schemes include:\n\nThe Scottish Government's £10 million Hydrogen Innovation Scheme (HIS) also offers funding to projects to help deliver and demonstrate renewable hydrogen technologies.\n\nCollectively, the approach taken in the UK towards electrolytic (green) hydrogen is to award grant funding to innovation projects via competitions and 'Contract for Difference' (CfD) revenue subsidy auctions via the HPBM mechanism. This strategy relies heavily on market-based solutions, emulating existing renewable energy subsidy support mechanisms, and taking a 'wait-and-see' approach to new grant-supported low-carbon technologies with the expectation that innovation can bypass cost disparities between mature hydrocarbon energy sources and low carbon hydrogen.\n\nThe risk of the current UK strategy towards low-carbon hydrogen is that this project- and market-driven approach, which lacks coherent direction and buy-in from key stakeholders involved in planning energy infrastructure in the UK, has resulted in hydrogen energy projects being stranded and left to fend for themselves when their implementation results in disruption or perceived disruption to the status quo. Two high-profile examples from 2023 include:\n\nThese challenges evidence the real risk that a 'hydrogen bubble' may emerge, where hydrogen as an energy vector remains confined to demonstration projects and unable to play the full role that National Grid ESO and others believe is required at an energy-system-level.\n\nIn the UK, electricity represents only ~20% of final energy consumption. Thus, decarbonisation progress to date relates primarily to the power sector (i.e., the low-hanging fruit). The journey to net-zero will require significant changes to the way we produce, transport, store, and consume energy. Relatively undisruptive changes to electricity generation and consumer-led electrification have so far not significantly challenged the architecture of the existing, largely fossil-based, energy system. However, key decisions needed to implement net-zero must be taken now if we are going to avoid what National Grid calls its 'Counterfactual' 2050 future energy scenario, where heavy reliance on fossil fuel remains in place, hydrogen production is limited to a mere 25 TWh per annum, and net-zero is not achieved.\n\nIn the UK, a positive development has been undertaken recently to improve planning and coordination of the energy transition with the launch this year of a new public-corporation, the National Energy System Operator (NESO), which incorporates part of National Grid ESO via renationalization. The new NESO has been charged with planning Great Britain's electricity and gas networks and will be responsible for coordination across the whole energy system and will consider the connections between energy vectors and their relationship with the wider system. It is hoped this effort to undertake joined-up thinking and planning can implement the most appropriate evidence-driven net-zero pathway, of which hydrogen should be a feature, and thus ensuring hydrogen can meet its full potential.\n\nHype or hope are opposite poles on the same continuum with slow burner somewhere in the middle. It has to be recognised that the hydrogen industry faces significant challenges, it is not just a hype or a hope, but a slow burner with significant potential. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of hydrogen and create a more sustainable energy future.\n\nThe perception of hydrogen as either \"hype\" or \"hope\" or \"slow burner\" is a matter of perspective (regional, national, and international). While there are challenges and uncertainties associated with hydrogen adoption, there is also significant potential for it to contribute to a sustainable energy future, particularly when integrated with other clean energy technologies. The trajectory of hydrogen's role in the global energy landscape depends on ongoing advancements, policy decisions, and market dynamics.\n\nHydrogen's role likely falls somewhere among these three perspectives. While there has been a certain degree of hype and excitement around its potential, there is also genuine hope for its contributions to a sustainable energy future. However, the practical challenges and complexities mean that its widespread adoption and integration will likely occur over a longer timeframe. The answer to the question hype, hope or slow burner is likely a bit of all three. There's no doubt that hydrogen has experienced a surge of hype, fuelled by its potential as a clean energy carrier and the increasing urgency to decarbonise various sectors and the need to find alternative green fuels to address the energy crisis post Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, whether this translates into a rapid revolution, or a more gradual evolution depends on many factors as discussed.\n\nHydrogen's trajectory will depend on continued research and development, advancements in production and storage technologies, supportive policies, and the evolution of global energy markets. It's essential to approach hydrogen with a balanced perspective that acknowledges both its potential and the practical considerations involved in realizing that potential. The concept of green hydrogen as a catalyst for hope reflects the belief that its potential benefits can inspire positive actions, policies, and advancements toward a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future.\n\nThis article provides material to power the ongoing debate for the strengths and weaknesses of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier. Certainly, the proportion of energy lost depends on the application and current technologies utilised. Currently transporting hydrogen gas by pipeline over thousands of kilometres is difficult, compression or liquefaction of the hydrogen, and transport by trucks does incur large energy losses. However, hydrogen solutions are viable for certain niche applications, 350 bar pressure use in buses and HGVs, low pressure storage in stationary tanks for cogeneration with engines or fuel cells and storing excess wind electricity as hydrogen for power generation during periods of calm are all current applications that are being deployed. As technology advances and next generation electrolysis technologies evolve then we will start to overcome the current obstacles and cross the current liminal threshold to a green economy built with hydrogen as one of the foundation blocks.\n\nIn conclusion, for many reasons hydrogen is the current hot issue and has become the victim of way too much public attention resulting in too high expectations and diverging views on its possible role in future energy systems. The current hype will settle and lead to an intelligent degree of rationalisation and acknowledgement that hydrogen will play an important role in decarbonising industry and heavy-duty transport while blending on a longer time scale will help to overcome renewable oversupply and effectively contribute to the decarbonisation of the gas sector as well.\n\nEurope may be one market, but it is certainly not a level playing field for green hydrogen production, storage, distribution and use. Therefore, the current envisaged \"one-size-fits-all\" approach will need to change and be reflective of the diverging characteristics and potential for renewable energy production across European countries.\n\nWhile hydrogen holds immense promise, it will not be an overnight revolution. The hype of 2022 and 2023 has cooled off and we are entering a state of reality where we can expect a more gradual transition, with early adoption in niche markets like heavy-duty vehicles and industrial applications. As technology matures and costs decrease, hydrogen will likely play an increasingly important role in the global energy mix. With continued investment in research and development, infrastructure development, and government support, hydrogen can play a crucial role in the transition to a low-carbon economy. However, it is essential to acknowledge the challenges and limitations of the industry and to adopt a pragmatic approach to its development.\n\nAs we look for solutions to our climate crisis, energy crisis and energy security we have a plethora of experts but what is required is leadership. In our expert world we quite rightly value expertise and knowledge informed and supported by data, metrics, analytical frameworks, and statistics. Experts, by nature, are conservative and cautious whilst leaders take us forward to new territories. The US diplomat Henry Kissinger stated, \"Most foreign policies that history has marked highly, in whatever country, have been originated by leaders who were opposed by experts. It is, after all, the responsibility of the expert to operate the familiar and that of the leader to transcend it.\"",

                            "body": "The Herd Road bridge that crosses Richards Creek will be closed for approximately four months as North Cowichan carries out major upgrades on the structure.\n\nNorth Cowichan's council approved the $1.7-million project at its meeting on April 16, and the work is expected to commence later this year.\n\nThe bridge, which connects the communities of Crofton and Maple Bay to the Trans-Canada Highway, is on Herd Road, which is a major arterial road carrying more than 2,500 vehicles per day east and 2,500 vehicles west.\n\nThe concrete 37-year old bridge is deteriorating, putting the structural integrity of the girders that support the bridge deck at risk.\n\nIn addition, some other structural components, such as the pile cap and piles that support the bridge girders, need minor repairs.\n\nJohn Dehoop, North Cowichan's manager of infrastructure, said in a staff report that the deterioration of the bridge has been caused by the application of road salt in the winter months, which, while necessary, can compromise the integrity of the structure's concrete deck.\n\nHe said that this will eventually lead to undermining the girders supporting the bridge deck.\n\n\"If salt-laden water is able to make its way through the bridge deck and migrate into the underlying structural components, the bridge structure itself may be damaged,\" Dehoop said.\n\n\"This type of deterioration is typical for bridges of this age on Vancouver Island, and the proposed work is considered normal based on the age of this structure. Based on an assessment from 2024, if the upgrades and minor repairs are not done, more extensive and costly repairs will be necessary. Such work would also require the bridge to be closed for a longer duration.\"\n\nThe project will address the deficiencies with the bridge deck and the underlying structure, as well as the bridge barriers that don't currently meet the latest design standards.\n\nDehoop said the bridge work is being coordinated with the Bell McKinnon Road/Herd Road roundabout construction project to reduce inconvenience to the public as much as possible.\n\nSeismic 2000 Construction Ltd.was awarded the contract with its bid of $1.7 million, which is well below the original estimate of $2.4 million for the bridge work.\n\nCoun. Mike Caljouw asked if 37 years is the normal lifespan for a bridge like the one on Herd Road.\n\nClay Reitsma, North Cowichan's director of engineering, said a bridge of this type typically has a lifespan of about 50 years before it has to be replaced.\n\n\"We're at year 37 and it's typical to have to do these kinds of repairs midstream so that we can extend the life of the bridge and get the 50 years out of it,\" he said.\n\nCoun. Bruce Findlay asked Reitsma what would the cost be if the bridge had to be entirely replaced.\n\n\"Don't quote me on this, but based on some of the estimates we have on other bridges, we're thinking about $7 million to $10 million,\" Reitsma said.\n\n\"It's really tough right now to predict these prices and, as each year goes by, I'm continually shocked by the increase in infrastructure costs.\"",

We are evaluating, diagnosing and talking about potential avenues, including engagement,\" the senior official told Axios.\n\nA former well-placed official in the US government said that Trump administration officials were doing some \"initial planning\" in the awareness that \"one flowery letter\" from Kim Jong-un could prompt Trump to head straight for dialogue.\n\n\"The Swedish ambassador to North Korea, who represents US interests in the country, visited Washington last week for consultations with US officials and experts. One source familiar with the visit said it was mostly about taking the temperature in Washington on engagement with Pyongyang,\" Axios reported.\n\n\"Officials from the State Department and National Security Council have also taken part in multiple roundtable discussions with outside experts on North Korea. One of the topics raised in those closed-door meetings was who the North Korean interlocutors are likely to be if talks do start,\" Axios said.\n\nMost of the North Korean officials who were involved with the Trump-Kim summits have been purged or are undergoing reeducation.\n\n\"The North Koreans don't seem to have named a new special envoy for US diplomacy,\" said Jenny Town, the director of the Korea program at the Stimson Center. \"Their position has been less negative about the prospects for negotiations lately, although they haven't said anything positive either.\"\n\n\"The regime's willingness to engage would depend on the nature of the conversation,\" Axios said, citing the former senior US official.\n\nSince North Korea's status as a nuclear power state is now explicitly endorsed by the country's constitution, Kim Jong-un is reportedly uninterested in discussing denuclearization, which was the topic of past talks.\n\nBut the former official said that if the agenda were about arms control and recognizing North Korea as a nuclear weapons state, \"they'll have those talks all day.\"\n\n\"Trump will also find it hard to generate the kind of leverage he had over Kim the first time around given North Korea's nuclear advances and stronger diplomatic position,\" Axios said.\n\n\"Chinese pressure on Pyongyang played a crucial role in Trump 1.0, but Beijing has made clear it's not interested in squeezing Kim again on Trump's behalf,\" Axios said, while noting that Pyongyang has \"deepened ties\" with Moscow by deploying troops to the war against Ukraine.\n\nAxios quoted the senior US official as saying that \"we are in a much worse situation today.\" That official blamed North Korea's nuclear advancement on the Biden administration.",

                            "body": "Transportation is the lifeblood of modern society, enabling the movement of people, goods, and ideas, which fuels economic growth, societal progress, and individual well-being. Its benefits are multifaceted, spanning economic prosperity, social connectivity, personal freedom, and access to essential services.\n\nTransportation's impact is far-reaching, shaping our lives in profound ways that are often taken for granted. Consider these core benefits:\n\nThe efficient movement of goods is paramount to a thriving economy. Effective supply chains, facilitated by robust transportation networks, allow businesses to access raw materials, manufacture products, and distribute them to consumers worldwide. This fosters competition, reduces prices, and expands market opportunities. Without reliable transportation, global trade would grind to a halt, crippling economies and limiting access to essential goods.\n\nTransportation connects people across geographical boundaries, fostering social interaction and cultural exchange. Whether it's commuting to work, visiting family and friends, or traveling for leisure, transportation allows us to build relationships, broaden our horizons, and experience different cultures. This promotes understanding, tolerance, and a more interconnected world.\n\nAccess to transportation provides individuals with increased freedom and independence. The ability to travel freely allows people to pursue educational opportunities, seek employment in diverse locations, access healthcare services, and participate in recreational activities. This empowerment contributes to a higher quality of life and greater personal fulfillment.\n\nTransportation is crucial for accessing essential services such as healthcare, education, and employment. In many communities, particularly in rural areas, reliable transportation is the only means of accessing these vital resources. Without it, individuals may be deprived of opportunities to improve their lives and contribute to society.\n\nTo further explore the significant benefits of transportation, let's address some frequently asked questions:\n\nTransportation infrastructure projects create numerous jobs directly and indirectly. From construction workers and engineers to truck drivers and logistics professionals, the transportation sector supports a vast network of employment opportunities. Furthermore, improved transportation facilitates economic growth, which in turn generates even more jobs across various industries. Investment in transportation infrastructure is therefore a powerful engine for job creation.\n\nWhile transportation provides significant benefits, it also poses environmental challenges, including air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and noise pollution. The burning of fossil fuels in vehicles contributes significantly to climate change and respiratory problems. Efforts to mitigate these challenges include developing cleaner transportation technologies, promoting public transportation, and encouraging sustainable urban planning.\n\nPublic transportation offers numerous advantages in urban areas, including reduced traffic congestion, improved air quality, and increased accessibility. By providing an alternative to private vehicles, public transportation helps to alleviate traffic jams, reduce emissions, and make cities more livable. It also provides affordable transportation options for low-income residents, improving their access to employment and other opportunities.\n\nAreas with good transportation infrastructure tend to have higher property values. Accessibility to major roads, public transportation, and airports increases the attractiveness of a location, making it more desirable for residents and businesses. This increased demand drives up property values and contributes to economic development.\n\nTechnology is transforming the transportation sector, improving efficiency and safety. Smart traffic management systems, GPS navigation, and autonomous vehicles are just a few examples of how technology is being used to optimize traffic flow, reduce accidents, and improve fuel efficiency. These advancements have the potential to revolutionize transportation and make it more sustainable.\n\nTransportation plays a crucial role in emergency response and disaster relief. During natural disasters or other emergencies, efficient transportation is essential for delivering aid, evacuating people, and providing medical care. Well-maintained roads, bridges, and airports are vital for ensuring a swift and effective response to emergencies.\n\nProviding transportation in rural areas presents unique challenges, including low population density, limited funding, and long distances. As a result, rural communities often lack access to reliable transportation options, which can hinder economic development and limit access to essential services. Innovative solutions, such as ride-sharing programs and demand-responsive transportation, are needed to address these challenges.\n\nTransportation is essential for tourism and recreation. Airports, highways, and public transportation systems enable people to travel to tourist destinations, explore new places, and participate in recreational activities. The tourism industry relies heavily on transportation, and improvements in transportation infrastructure can lead to increased tourism and economic benefits for local communities.\n\nEfficient transportation is vital for global trade and supply chains. Reliable transportation networks allow businesses to move goods across borders, access raw materials, and distribute finished products to consumers worldwide. Disruptions to transportation, such as port congestion or border delays, can have significant impacts on global trade and the economy.\n\nMaking transportation more sustainable requires a multifaceted approach, including investing in renewable energy sources, promoting public transportation, encouraging walking and cycling, and developing more fuel-efficient vehicles. Sustainable transportation solutions aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and minimize the environmental impact of transportation.\n\nTransportation policies have a significant impact on urban development. Investments in public transportation can encourage denser, more walkable urban environments, while investments in highways can lead to suburban sprawl. Transportation policies should be carefully considered to promote sustainable, equitable, and livable urban areas.\n\nThe future of transportation is likely to be shaped by several key trends, including autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, shared mobility services, and drone delivery. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize transportation, making it more efficient, sustainable, and accessible. However, careful planning and regulation will be needed to ensure that these technologies are deployed safely and equitably.\n\nTransportation is not merely a means of getting from point A to point B; it is a fundamental enabler of progress, connecting people, markets, and ideas. Understanding the multifaceted benefits of transportation is crucial for making informed decisions about transportation infrastructure, policies, and investments. By prioritizing sustainable and equitable transportation solutions, we can ensure that transportation continues to contribute to economic prosperity, social well-being, and a higher quality of life for all. Investing in a robust and adaptable transportation system is an investment in our collective future.",

                            "body": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's capital killed at least eight people overnight, the Houthi rebels said Monday, as the American military acknowledged carrying out over 800 individual strikes in their monthlong campaign.\n\nThe overnight statement from the U.S. military's Central Command also said its \"Operation Roughrider\" targeting the rebels had \"killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders,\" including those associated with its missile and drone program. It did not identify any of those officials.\n\nThe U.S. insisted it would continue to carry out its airstrikes, which began March 15 under President Donald Trump as he seeks a deal with Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.\n\n\"Iran undoubtedly continues to provide support to the Houthis,\" the statement said. \"The Houthis can only continue to attack our forces with the backing of the Iranian regime.\"\n\nIt added: \"We will continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region.\"\n\nThe U.S. is targeting the Houthis because of the group's attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a crucial global trade route, and on Israel. The Houthis also are the last militant group in Iran's self-described \"Axis of Resistance\" that is capable of regularly attacking Israel.\n\nStrike in Sanaa kills 8, Houthis say\n\nEarly Monday, the Houthis aired footage of what it described as a U.S. strike targeting the Bani Al Harith District north of Yemen's rebel-held capital, Sanaa. Blood stains could be seen among the rubble and a damaged truck. The Houths' al-Masirah satellite news channel reported that eight people were killed in the strike, something not immediately acknowledged by Health Ministry officials.\n\nStrikes also hit Yemen's Amran and Saada governorates during the night, the Houthis added. Two others were killed on Sunday, the Houthis said.\n\nAssessing the toll of the month-old U.S. airstrike campaign has been difficult because the military hasn't released specific information about the attacks, including what was targeted and how many people were killed. The Houthis, meanwhile, strictly control access to attacked areas and don't publish complete information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites. Funeral notices suggest high-ranking Houthis have been killed in the American attacks.\n\n\"To preserve operational security, we have intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations,\" Central Command said Monday. \"We are very deliberate in our operational approach, but will not reveal specifics about what we've done or what we will do.\"\n\nBut the military hasn't acknowledged strikes killing civilians -- something activists warn likely has happened in the intense campaign.\n\nUS discusses deadly port strike\n\nThe U.S. is conducting strikes from its two aircraft carriers in the region -- the USS Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea and the USS Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea.\n\nOn April 18, an American strike on the Ras Isa fuel port killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others in the deadliest-known attack of the American campaign. Central Command on Monday offered an explanation for why it hit the port.\n\n\"U.S. strikes destroyed the ability of Ras Isa Port to accept fuel which will begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities,\" it said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Houthis have increasingly sought to control the flow of information from the territory it holds to the outside world. It issued a notice Sunday that all those holding Starlink satellite internet receivers should \"quickly hand over\" the devices to authorities.\n\n\"A field campaign will be implemented in coordination with the security authorities to arrest anyone who sells, trades, uses, operates, installs or possesses these prohibited terminals,\" the Houthis warned.\n\nStarlink terminals have been crucial for Ukraine in fighting Russia's full-scale invasion and receivers also have been smuggled into Iran amid unrest there.",

                            "body": "Details: Gray wave 2 appears complete. Navy blue wave 1 of 3 is now underway.\n\nThe NIKKEI 225 daily chart indicates a bullish trend is forming through an impulsive Elliott Wave structure. After completing the gray wave 2 correction, the index has entered navy blue wave 1 within the larger gray wave 3 setup. This position suggests the early movement of a fresh impulse, which could drive significant upward momentum in the coming sessions.\n\nNavy blue wave 1 marks the starting point of this new impulsive advance. Usually, this phase features building momentum as the market gains direction. The end of gray wave 2 sets a clear stage for wave 1, typically showing steady but not yet aggressive price moves. Current developments imply that the market will continue rising gradually before meeting the next correction.\n\nA key level to watch is 30,726. If the price falls below this point, the current bullish wave count would be invalid, and a reevaluation would be needed. This level serves as crucial support, safeguarding the low of wave 2.\n\nThe daily chart offers a broad view of the new wave structure. The present impulse wave shows potential for establishing further upward momentum. Traders should look for typical wave signs like increasing volume and a stable uptrend. However, it is normal for wave 1 to move slower compared to the stronger momentum expected in wave 3.\n\nThe next step to expect is the development of navy blue wave 2 after the completion of wave 1. This upcoming correction should offer a pullback opportunity before a stronger rally in wave 3 begins. Watching price action closely along with momentum indicators will help confirm the wave progress and spot the transition into wave 2.\n\nTechnical signals and price movements will be vital in verifying the unfolding wave structure. Moving into gray wave 3 at a higher degree hints at more powerful momentum ahead. This early stage is key for setting up positions and preparing for further upward growth.\n\nThe NIKKEI 225 weekly chart shows a strong bullish trend building through an impulsive Elliott Wave pattern. After completing the gray wave 2 correction, the index has moved into gray wave 3 within the larger orange wave 3 structure. This move marks entry into the most powerful phase of the trend, typically showing extended price growth and strong momentum.\n\nGray wave 3 usually signals the core trend segment in Elliott patterns, often bringing the sharpest price increases. Completing wave 2's correction clears the path for this major advance. Wave 3 often surpasses the reach of wave 1. Current readings suggest the market will likely continue upward strongly before meeting the next corrective move.\n\nThe weekly chart offers critical insight into the broader structure. Current action suggests a major bullish phase is developing. Moving into orange wave 3 at a higher degree indicates an even larger upward sequence may be forming over a longer timeframe.\n\nA key level to monitor is 30,726. If the market breaks below this level, the current bullish interpretation would be invalid, requiring a new wave analysis.\n\nTraders should watch wave 3's growth for classic signs such as strong momentum, rising volume, and smooth upward progression. Analysis recommends maintaining bullish exposure during this impulsive phase but staying alert for signals of wave 3 nearing completion.\n\nThe next expected movement is gray wave 4 after gray wave 3 completes. This correction should offer a good pullback chance before any further extension of the bullish trend.\n\nThis current phase typically provides the best conditions for trading within Elliott Wave progressions.",

                            "body": "Despite tariff-related challenges, analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin's future, forecasting significant growth in the global hashrate by July 2025.\n\nAccording to the latest Cambridge survey, the US has firmly established itself as the world's largest Bitcoin (BTC) mining hub, accounting for 75.4% of the reported hashrate.\n\nThis comes as the country continues to prioritize the comprehensive development of the Bitcoin mining industry.\n\nThe findings from Cambridge were outlined in the recent Cambridge Digital Mining Industry Report. The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) conducted the survey between June and September 2024.\n\nOf 97 companies that registered for the survey, 49 completed it, resulting in a response rate of 50.5%. The report highlighted that the US significantly outpaced all other countries regarding Bitcoin mining dominance.\n\n\"Survey results further indicate that the US has solidified its position as the largest global mining hub (75.4% of reported activity),\" the report read.\n\nCanada came in second, at 7.1%. Paraguay, Norway, and Kazakhstan followed with 3.4%, 2.8%, and 2.6%, respectively. However, due to the US-dominated sample of respondents, the survey's findings may not fully reflect the global distribution of Bitcoin mining.\n\nAs a result, Cambridge acknowledged that the data may overrepresent US activity in Bitcoin mining and underrepresent activity in other countries. In fact, the latest data from the Hashrate Index showed that the US only accounts for 36.0% of the global hashrate.\n\nStill, the figure underlines the US' dominance in the industry, a position the country is looking to expand further. Recently, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick shared the nation's vision to boost the mining industry.\n\nLutnick highlighted the Commerce Department's investment accelerator initiative as a key resource to help miners gain greater autonomy over their energy needs. On March 31, President Trump signed an executive order establishing the \"United States Investment Accelerator.\"\n\nThe initiative seeks to streamline regulatory processes and facilitate investments above $1 billion. In a recent interview, Lutnick explained the investment accelerator's benefits for miners.\n\n\"We're going to make it if you want to mine Bitcoin and you find the right place to do it. You can build your own power plant next to it,\" he stated.\n\nSecretary Lutnick envisions that this could help Bitcoin mining companies become more independent from traditional energy grids. A notable aspect of this vision is using waste gas from gas fields to power mining operations.\n\nThis could lower energy costs and reduce environmental impact. By controlling their energy supply, miners would have the flexibility to manage costs more effectively, potentially boosting Bitcoin mining in America.\n\n\"The next generation of miners in America will be able to control their destiny, control the cost of power, and I think that is going to turbocharge uh Bitcoin mining in America,\" Lutnick added.\n\nAs Lutnick's vision materializes, companies are already positioning themselves to capitalize on the favorable conditions. Cleanspark, a Bitcoin mining company, is nearing approval for a new facility in Tennessee. This project is expected to strengthen the US mining sector, capitalizing on favorable regulations and access to energy resources.\n\nInterestingly, the sector has also attracted attention from high-profile figures, such as Eric and Donald Trump Jr. Last month, the President's son's partnered with Hut 8 to launch American Bitcoin Corp.\n\nThis new venture focuses on large-scale Bitcoin mining and building a strategic reserve. The firm has also outlined its ambition to go public in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, this rapid scaling of mining operations could significantly impact the global hashrate, which has already shown rapid growth in Q4 2024.\n\n\"The Bitcoin mining industry has largely shrugged off halving-related concerns, with network hashrate accelerating sharply in Q4 2024. This surge was driven by a combination of favourable political developments and a strong price rally, propelling the hashrate to a record high of 900 Eh/s,\" the CoinShares report noted.\n\nNotably, market analysts at CoinShares project that the global Bitcoin hashrate could surpass 1 zettahash per second (ZH/s) by July 2025. Moreover, by 2027, the number is expected to increase to 2 ZH/s.\n\nNonetheless, concerns remain. Tariffs on Southeast Asian countries, where most mining equipment is sourced from, increase costs.\n\nThis could lead to higher operational expenses, threatening profitability and US market dominance. Given this, CoinShares' analysts also project that Q1 and Q2 2025 results may be less favorable.\n\n\"Q1 results could disappoint as hash price continued its decline due to Bitcoin trading in a narrow range between US$80,000 and US$90,000. Q2 results may show deterioration, as tariffs on imported mining rigs range from 24% (Malaysia) to 54% (China). Miners relying on older or less efficient rigs face higher exposure to these tariffs,\" they remarked.\n\nDespite the challenges, analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin's future. It is gaining traction as a reserve asset among several US states. Furthermore, inflation and currency devaluation could strengthen Bitcoin's role as a hedge against economic uncertainty.",

                            "body": "By 7 a.m., more than 99% of energy demand in Spain had been restored, the country's electricity operator Red Eléctrica said. Portuguese grid operator REN said Tuesday morning all of the 89 power substations were back online since late last night and power had been restored to all 6.4 million customers.\n\nBy Tuesday morning, life was returning to normal: schools and offices reopened in Spain, traffic eased along the capital's main arteries and public transport restarted after significant delays.\n\nSpanish authorities did not provide new explanations for what caused the blackout, one of the most serious to ever take place in Europe.\n\nIn a televised address Monday night, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the power grid for the Southern European nation of 49 million people lost 15 gigawatts -- equivalent to 60% of its national demand -- in just five seconds.\n\n\"We have never had a complete collapse of the system,\" Sánchez said. Authorities were still investigating what happened on Tuesday.\n\nSuch widespread electric failure has little precedent on the Iberian Peninsula or in Europe.\n\nOn Tuesday, Spain's meteorological agency AEMET said that it had not detected any \"unusual meteorological or atmospheric phenomena\" on Monday, and no sudden temperature fluctuations were recorded at their weather stations.\n\nPortugal's National Cybersecurity Center on Monday threw cold water on feverish speculation about foul play, saying there was no sign that the outage resulted from a cyber attack. European Council President Antonio Costa also said there were \"no indications of any cyber attack\" Monday afternoon.\n\nTeresa Ribera, an executive vice president of the European Commission, also ruled out sabotage. Nonetheless, the outage \"is one of the most serious episodes recorded in Europe in recent times,\" she said.\n\nAt Spain's largest train stations, droves of travelers waited Tuesday morning to board trains, or to rebook tickets for journeys that were canceled or disrupted on Monday and return home.\n\nAt Atocha station in Madrid, hundreds of people stood near screens waiting for updates. Many had spent the night at the station, wrapped in blankets provided by the Red Cross around 1 a.m. Tuesday morning for those who had to wait overnight thanks to canceled trains. Similar scenes played out at Barcelona's Sants station.\n\nThe Madrid Open tennis tournament being held this week was still affected by the power outage Tuesday after its cancellation the previous day. Tournament organizers delayed opening its doors.\n\nMetro systems restored but other trains still disrupted\n\nBy 11 a.m. Tuesday, service on Madrid's metro system was fully restored. In Barcelona, the system was operating normally but commuter trains were suspended due to \"electrical instability,\" the company that runs the service, Rodalies Catalunya, said on X.\n\nIn some parts of the country, commuter and mid-distance services were still suspended or running at reduced capacity.\n\nEmergency workers in Spain said they had rescued some 35,000 passengers on Monday stranded along railways and underground, with the blackout turning sports centers, train stations and airports into makeshift overnight refuges.\n\nOn Monday, Rubén Carión was stranded on a commuter train outside Madrid, when he pried the window open and walked to the nearest transit station by foot. Then, he spent the night in the city's Atocha station after his train back to Barcelona was canceled.\n\nThe 24-year-old said he chose to wait overnight at the station instead of a hotel so he could stay updated on when he could board a train home, describing his experience as \"pure chaos.\"",

To achieve peace through strength, Treasury will continue to take all available measures to deprive Iran's access to resources necessary to advance its missile programme.\"\n\nThe April 29 move targeted five China-based companies, one Iran-based firm and six Iran-based people. The Treasury accused the network of facilitating the procurement of sodium perchlorate and dioctyl sebacate from China to Iran.\n\nIt said sodium perchlorate is used to produce ammonium perchlorate, which alongside dioctyl sebacate is usable in solid propellant rocket motors, which Treasury said is commonly used for ballistic missiles.\n\nThe April 29 move is the latest action targeting Tehran since Mr Trump restored his \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Iran, which includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero to help prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon.\n\nIn his first 2017-2021 term, Mr Trump withdrew the US from a 2015 deal between Iran and world powers that placed strict limits on Tehran's uranium enrichment activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Mr Trump also reimposed sweeping US sanctions.\n\nSince then, Iran has far surpassed that deal's limits on uranium enrichment.\n\nWestern powers accuse Iran of having a clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons capability by enriching uranium to a high level of fissile purity, above what they say is justifiable for a civilian atomic energy programme.\n\nTehran says its nuclear programme is wholly for civilian power purposes.

                            "body": "The EU promised a renewable energy future - but is it still on track? As political shifts, policy delays and legal battles unfold, the energy transition faces new hurdles. Are we still moving forward, or is Europe starting to backpedal? Seden Anlar reports.\n\nOnce upon a time - 2019, to be exact - the European Green Deal was the golden child of EU policy. Politicians across the spectrum embraced it with enthusiasm, promising a continent powered by renewables and free from climate-wrecking emissions by 2050. Fast forward five years and that green glow has started to fade. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 threw energy markets into chaos, exposing the bloc's dependence on fossil fuels. The subsequent scramble for energy security did accelerate some aspects of the energy transition, but it also shifted the EU's focus toward immediate economic and defence concerns. Then came the political earthquake of 2024: an unprecedented surge of far-right and conservative parties swept into power, many of them itching to tear up environmental regulations in favour of 'competitiveness' and 'deregulation'.\n\nThis shifting political landscape has already translated into action. The EU recently delayed its landmark Deforestation Regulation following industry pushback, while the far-right European Conservatives and Reformists and the newly formed Patriots for Europe group have signalled their intent to weaken or dismantle key elements of the European Green Deal. With growing political opposition, the future of Europe's clean energy transition is increasingly uncertain. Is it still on track - or are these headwinds beginning to slow it down?\n\nDespite this political pushback, the EU's energy transition is still advancing - at least on paper. In 2024, nearly half of the bloc's electricity came from renewables, a dramatic leap from just 34% in 2019. This isn't just progress - it's a structural shift. Use of fossil fuels is crumbling. Coal, once the backbone of Europe's power system, has plummeted to less than 10% of the electricity mix - its lowest share in decades. And in a symbolic turning point, solar energy overtook coal for the first time ever.\n\nWind, meanwhile, held its position as the second-largest energy source after nuclear, continuing to outpace fossil gas. That's significant. Europe's gas-powered electricity production has been shrinking for five straight years, despite rising energy demand and an increase in EU power exports. Even as the bloc has had to send more electricity across borders - to energy-strapped countries like Ukraine and the UK - fossil fuel reliance has continued to decline. However, while the EU as a whole has made impressive strides - with wind and solar now generating nearly half of the bloc's electricity and coal on life support - at the national level, the pace of progress is wildly uneven.\n\nThe EU's energy transition isn't just an abstract political debate - it's playing out in real time across its Member States. Some countries are embracing the energy transition with open arms, pushing ambitious policies and accelerating their shift toward renewables. Others? They're treating it like an inconvenient chore - dragging their feet, delaying commitments or quietly lowering their targets when no one is looking.\n\nTo understand these differences, one can look at National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) - the blueprint for achieving the European Green Deal. Each Member State is legally required to submit one, outlining how they plan to ramp up renewables, cut emissions and improve energy efficiency. A strong NECP signals real commitment, backed by clear policies and investments. A weak or missing NECP is a flashing red warning sign that a country is stalling or backpedalling on climate policy. And right now, those warning signs are everywhere - some countries are pushing ahead, while others are falling behind or not even showing up.\n\nSome Member States aren't just meeting EU targets - they're surpassing them. Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands have made notable progress in scaling up wind and solar, setting ambitious targets that, in some cases, go beyond what the EU requires.\n\nSpain, for example, has pledged a renewable energy contribution that exceeds EU targets by 10 percentage points. The country has significantly expanded its solar and wind capacity in recent years, reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and increasing domestic electricity generation. Denmark, a country with a long-standing focus on renewables, is projected to overachieve its national targets. The country has continued to expand its wind energy sector, which already plays a key role in its electricity mix.\n\nThe Netherlands, despite previously lagging behind in the energy transition, has increased efforts to develop offshore wind projects and phase out coal power. While challenges remain, such as grid congestion and the need for further infrastructure investments, recent policy developments indicate an effort to accelerate the shift away from fossil fuels.\n\nBut not everyone is moving in the right direction. For instance, France (a self-proclaimed climate leader) and Sweden (a long-time renewables frontrunner) are quietly falling short. Their latest NECPs expose gaps in renewable targets, raising doubts about their ability to meet EU climate goals.\n\nFrance's updated NECP includes a renewable energy contribution that is 10 percentage points lower than what is required under EU law - one of the largest deficits among Member States. For a country that likes to present itself as a climate leader, this is a glaring contradiction. France's government has long prioritised its nuclear industry over renewables, and while nuclear is a low-carbon energy source, its reluctance to rapidly scale up wind and solar is now putting it out of step with EU-wide efforts.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising underperformer is Sweden. Unlike France, Sweden isn't just missing its renewable target - it hasn't even provided one in its latest NECP. For a country that has historically been seen as a climate leader, its lack of a clear commitment to expanding wind and solar in the updated plan has been noted as a significant omission. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess whether Sweden is on track to meet its long-term climate objectives.\n\nThe challenges with NECPs extend beyond weak commitments - some countries have struggled to submit them on time. Despite a legally binding deadline of 30 June 2024, by mid-October 2024, only 11 out of 27 EU Member States had submitted their final updated plans. In November 2024, the European Commission urged the remaining EU Member States to submit their overdue NECPs, emphasising the importance of timely and complete submissions. While the number of submitted plans increased to 22 out of 27 by February 2025, several countries still missed the deadline or provided incomplete plans.\n\nIf governments are delaying or deprioritising these plans, it raises broader questions about whether the EU's current governance framework is effectively ensuring compliance with its climate goals - or if national political shifts are starting to undermine collective progress.\n\nThe lack of ambition in several NECPs has not gone unnoticed. A coalition of environmental NGOs has taken legal action against France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden, arguing that their weak or incomplete plans violate EU climate laws. Their case is built on multiple shortcomings: these plans not only fall short of legally binding renewable energy targets, but they also lack transparency on fossil fuel subsidies - a critical accountability measure that ensures governments disclose financial support for high-emission industries. Additionally, the NGOs argue that these Member States have failed to involve the public in the decision-making process, despite public consultation being a key requirement under the EU's governance framework.\n\nMeanwhile, energy analysts have raised similar concerns, warning that governments are not keeping pace with market developments. The energy think tank Ember Energy has been particularly direct, saying that '[r]enewable energy markets have moved forward, but governments have not'. The private sector is already investing in wind and solar at record levels, with new capacity additions continuing to grow across the EU.\n\nHowever, without strong policies at the Member State level, infrastructure upgrades and grid expansions, this momentum may not be enough to keep the EU on track for its 2030 and 2050 climate targets. Many governments have yet to align their policy frameworks with the pace of private sector investments, leading to growing concerns that bottlenecks in permitting, financing and grid modernisation could slow down the energy transition just as it needs to accelerate.\n\nAt this point, the EU's energy transition stands at a crossroads. The numbers tell one story - record highs for renewables, record lows for fossil fuels - but the political reality is more complex. The transition is happening, but its pace depends on whether governments push forward or let momentum stall.\n\nFor renewables to continue expanding, governments must go beyond market forces. Strengthening NECPs is a crucial first step, ensuring they align with legally binding EU climate targets rather than being watered down or delayed. But policy alone isn't enough - governments must also balance economic, environmental and social concerns.\n\nWhether Europe stays on track or backpedals depends on the political choices made today. The technology is ready, and the market is moving - but without clear leadership, public investment and an inclusive approach, progress could stall.\n\nThe next few years will be critical. Will the European Commission enforce compliance? Will civil society pressure governments to raise ambition? Or will political forces opposed to the Green Deal succeed in stalling progress?\n\nWhat's clear is this: renewables aren't slowing down - but climate politics might be.",

                            "body": "Visa and stablecoin infrastructure provider startup Bridge are partnering to offer stablecoin-linked Visa cards to customers across multiple countries in Latin America, which the companies say will allow users to make everyday purchases in cryptocurrency tokens.\n\nThe move comes as the U.S. Congress appears likely to pass a bill creating stablecoin rules for the first time, which experts say could pave the way for more financial firms to use or issue their own stablecoins.\n\nWHY IT'S IMPORTANT\n\nStablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant value, usually a 1:1 dollar peg, are commonly used by crypto traders to move funds between tokens. Proponents say that they could be used to send payments instantly, but it remains challenging to use stablecoins for everyday purchases because merchants typically don't accept payments in crypto.\n\nBridge - which was acquired by Stripe earlier this year - will work on the back-end of transactions that customers make with their linked Visa cards to deduct funds from a user's stablecoin balance and then will convert the payment into the local currency for merchants.\n\nCONTEXT\n\nThrough the partnership with Visa, developers building products on Bridge will be able to add stablecoin-linked Visa cards to their slate of offerings.\n\nUsers will be able to use the stablecoin-linked cards at any merchants that accept Visa in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Chile. Bridge and Visa say that the product will become available in Europe, Africa and Asia in the coming months.\n\nKEY QUOTES\n\n\"We feel like the moment is now to take some of the things that we've already been doing in a more experimental, pilot basis and start to expose them to the world as capabilities that we anticipate will really start to become big and meaningful and globally scalable,\" said Jack Forestell, chief product and strategy officer at Visa.\n\nFor consumers to use stablecoins at a large-scale, they will have to be interoperable with existing tools and services that customers and businesses are accustomed to, said Zach Abrams, CEO of Bridge.\n\n\"This enables folks to use and take advantage of the benefits of stablecoins wherever they are in the world, but remain wholly connected with the financial tools that folks use,\" he said.",

                            "title": "Musk Again Attacks F-35 Fighters; Says Chinese Swarm Drones Can Destroy Manned Jets In Seconds",
                            "body": "Fresh salvos have been fired in the Elon Musk vs F-35 war even as the aircraft maker Lockheed Martin, after losing out on the contract to build the US Air Force's 6th generation fighter jet, vowed to upgrade the 5th generation F-35 Lightning II with 6th generation technology.\n\nTech czar Musk has never veiled his disdain for the most expensive weapon development program in the Pentagon's history, repeatedly calling the F-35s \"obsolete\" and \"expensive\" in the era of cheap swarms of drones.\n\nOn earlier occasions as well, Musk has called the F-35 program the \"worst military value for money in history\". His views have garnered attention, particularly since he was appointed to advise the US government on optimizing federal spending.\n\nMusk's recent statement was made on X, in the context of the burgeoning Chinese drone technologies. The ballooning F-35 cost was raised by investigative journalist Laura Loomer.\n\nShe claimed that Lockheed Martin was \"delivering F-35 fighter jets that are simply not ready for combat.\"\n\nMedia reports in the past have claimed that, even in 2025, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program has not been able to meet guidelines for developing and testing software, particularly with the long-delayed Technology Refresh 3 and Block 4 efforts, according to the annual Operational Test and Evaluation report.\n\nIn response to Loomer, Musk wrote on X: \"Crewed aircraft will be destroyed instantly by cheap drone swarms\".\n\nThe F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, developed by Lockheed Martin, is the Department of Defense's most expensive and ambitious weapons program.\n\nDespite being praised for its critical role in US national security, the program has been consistently criticized for its excessive expenses and delays. The program is the most expensive military endeavor in history, with the US Government Accountability Office estimating that its lifetime cost will exceed US$2 trillion.\n\nIn 2024, a declassified Pentagon report revealed the program's flaws. It said: \"The overall reliability, maintainability, and availability of the US fleet remains below service expectations.\" Lockheed Martin responded that the F-35 \"consistently meets or exceeds the reliability performance requirements we are contracted to deliver,\" as \"almost 90% of F-35 components are performing better than required.\" The aircraft is operational in 20 allied countries as well.\n\nWhile awarding the contract for the Next Generation Air Dominance Platform, christened F-47, to Boeing, the US government has vowed to learn from the mistakes committed in developing the 5th-generation F-35 Lightning II, which has turned it into a boondoggle weapon program.\n\nThe biggest mistake of all time has been that the US government does not own the intellectual property associated with the development of the 5th-generation fighter. This has given the primary contractor control over several aspects of the aircraft's lifecycle.\n\nOver the years, the US Air Force has discussed the lessons learned from the development of F-35 fighter jets. One major issue has been the \"concurrency\" approach, where production began even before the design was fully frozen. This led to costly and time-consuming design changes during production.\n\nLockheed Martin finally broke its silence when its Chief Executive, Jim Taiclet, claimed that the company can integrate 80% of sixth-generation NGAD technology into its fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II, which is already in production (with more than 1,100 produced so far), at half the cost. This upgrade will create what will be known as the \"fifth-generation plus\" variant of the F-35. \"We're basically going to take the [F-35] chassis and turn it into a Ferrari,\" Taiclet asserted.\n\nThe importance of manned fighter jets for long-drawn-out important missions has not been disputed, but the rise of the Chinese drone industry has created ripples in the strategies of the world's leading countries.\n\n\"Chinese drones like DJI or military models cost a thousandth of the price of an F-35 but can destroy one in seconds,\" Musk has previously written.\n\n\"Crewed fighter jets are an inefficient way to extend the range of missiles or drop bombs. A reusable drone can do so without all the overhead of a human pilot. And fighter jets will be shot down very quickly if the opposing force has sophisticated SAM or drones, as shown by the Russia-Ukraine conflict,\" Musk has opined.\n\nEven before the Ukraine-Russia war underscored that the future warfare will have a greater component of unmanned combat vehicles, China had factored unmanned systems into its strategic planning.\n\nChina's 2019 defense white paper states that \"there is a prevailing trend to develop long-range precision, intelligent, stealthy or unmanned weaponry or equipment.\" It adds that \"intelligent warfare is on the horizon.\"\n\nChina has developed both strike-capable systems and non-weaponized systems for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. A 2018 DoD report noted that the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) \"is closing the gap with the US Air Force across a spectrum of capabilities, gradually eroding longstanding US technical advantages.\"\n\nChina's Wing Loong and Caihong (CH) series have become platforms of choice for countries worldwide, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. It also has a fleet of reconnaissance drones, including the High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) Soaring Dragon and Cloud Shadow.\n\nChina's domination of the drone market was on full display during the Zhuhai air show in 2024. Beijing unveiled new members of China's CH drone family, including CH-9, a large-sized armed reconnaissance drone, and CH-7, the latest upgraded version of the stealth early-warning drone.\n\nAnother low-cost drone, CH-3D, and a cargo drone, CH-YH1000, were also on display.\n\nThe CH-9, the latest entry in the CH armed reconnaissance drone series, has a range of 11,500 kilometers and can take off with a weight of 5,000 kilograms. It can fly for 40 hours doing surveillance.\n\nBesides these drones, China has unveiled the next-generation' Mother of all drones,' capable of carrying smaller drones in its belly.\n\nThe Jetank, a heavy unmanned aerial vehicle, was showcased for the first time at the Zhuhai Air Show 2024, which concluded on November 17. The large drone can carry missiles, bombs, and smaller drones, earning the moniker of \"swarm carrier.\"\n\nThe Jetank was displayed at the outdoor static display area of the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). According to the Global Times, it has a maximum takeoff weight of 16 tons, a maximum payload capacity of six tons, and a wingspan of 25 meters.\n\nThe next-generation unmanned platform features eight hardpoints and can switch mission modules by utilizing different modularized payloads. The display showed the drone equipped with a radar system and an electro-optical pod at its nose. It can be linked to the satellite, providing battlefield situational awareness and remote-control capability.\n\nThe US Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines Drone Swarms as consisting of coordinated systems of at least three and potentially thousands of drones that can perform missions autonomously with minimal human oversight.\n\nThese swarms utilize swarm intelligence by emulating biological patterns observed in groups of ants, bees, or birds, where decentralized rules generate complex collective behavior.\n\nModern drone swarms integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to navigate obstacles such as GPS jamming, radio signal interference, and adverse environmental conditions, thereby maintaining synchronized operations.\n\nThe crewed jets require high maintenance and intensive training, along with substantial infrastructure, as opposed to drone swarms, which are cost-effective and scalable. A single F-35 costs approximately $80 million, while a swarm of 1,000 drones might be deployed for a fraction of that price, leveraging mass production and modular design.\n\nThe drone swarms are set to become battlefield disruptors, utilizing artificial intelligence to execute complex maneuvers.\n\nThe militaries around the world have announced their respective swarm drone programs. The French Icarus project, the Russian Lightning, the Spanish RAPAZ, the UK's Blue Bear swarm, and the UAE/South African N-Raven.\n\nThe Pentagon's Replicator program aims to deploy thousands of inexpensive, autonomous drones by August 2025. With $500 million allocated for Fiscal Year 2024 and additional requests for FY 2025, efforts focus on Autonomous Collaborative Teaming (ACT) and Opportunistic Resilient Network Topology (ORIENT) to ensure effective drone coordination and communication.\n\nThe US has another project, the Perdix System, that has been operational since 2016. Integrated with the F/A-18 fighter jets, it has undergone rigorous testing. Over 670 Perdix drones have been produced, showcasing significant advancements in swarm capabilities.\n\nIn the Perdix system drone swarm, the micro drone swarm is launched from F/A-18 Super Hornets. It autonomously carries out a range of missions, demonstrating collective decision-making, adaptive formation flying, and self-healing capabilities.\n\nPerdix are not pre-programmed, synchronized individuals; they are a collective organism, sharing a single distributed brain for decision-making and adapting to one another like swarms in nature. Because every Perdix communicates and collaborates with every other Perdix, the swarm has no leader and can gracefully adapt to drones entering or exiting the team.",

                            "body": "The first was that he would successfully conclude diplomatic deals in the Ukrainian-Russian war and in Iran. The second was that he wouldn't mind expanding American territory. Neither claim is entirely new, but elements of each were made with greater clarity than before.\n\nAfter saying that he believes that peace is possible in Ukraine with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky both as presidents, but that success was contingent upon Trump being the president negotiating the deal, Trump was asked specifically about two difficult questions in the negotiations: NATO membership for Ukraine and territorial agreements.\n\nTrump said two things about NATO. Crucially for the negotiations, when asked if Ukraine should \"give up any hope of ever joining NATO,\" he said, \"I don't think they'll ever be able to join NATO.\" Three days earlier, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellog told Ukrainian, French, British and German officials that \"NATO isn't on the table.\" Trump's answer to the Time's interviewers is a clear statement of that American position in negotiations. The one-page peace plan that the U.S. presented to Ukraine in Paris on April 17 as the United State's \"final offer\" firmly states that \"Ukraine will not seek to join NATO.\"\n\nThe second thing Trump said about NATO was that \"what caused the war to start was when they started talking about joining NATO.\" Talk of the war being provoked and Russia having legitimate security concerns has been heresy in the West. But it is a point that has been conceded by both Ukraine and NATO.\n\nDavid Arakhamia, who led the Ukrainian negotiating team in the Belarus and Istanbul talks, confirmed that an assurance that Ukraine would not join NATO was the \"key point\" for Russia. According to Arakhamia, \"They were prepared to end the war if we agreed to, as Finland once did, neutrality, and committed that we would not join NATO.\" Zelensky, himself, said that the promise not to join NATO \"was the first fundamental point for the Russian Federation\" and that \"as far as I remember, they started a war because of this.\"\n\nJens Stoltenberg, who was then the Secretary General of NATO, said that a NATO promise of no further enlargement \"was a precondition\" for Russia \"not [to] invade Ukraine.\" Putin, Stoltenberg said, \"went to war to prevent NATO, more NATO, close to his borders.\"\n\nMoving from NATO to a territorial settlement, Time asked Trump if Russia should get to keep Crimea. Trump answered flatly that \"Crimea will stay with Russia.\" According to \"a source close to [Trump's special envoy Steve] Witkoff,\" \"The deal on the table is that the Russian-occupied territory is going to remain occupied. Russia's not pulling it out of it. That part is set in stone.\" The U.S. peace plan sets out that Washington will officially recognize \"Russian control of Crimea\" and de facto recognize territory in the Donbas currently occupied by Russia as under \"Russian control.\" Trump's Time statement seems to confirm a settled American position on Crimea.\n\nAs with Ukraine, Trump expressed optimism about successfully negotiating a nuclear agreement with Iran. However, he maintained the military threat.",

New Delhi, Apr 28 (PTI) Union Power Minister Manohar Lal on Monday said that measures such as faster land acquisition and securing diversified uranium fuel sources are crucial in scaling up domestic nuclear energy capacity.\n\nHe said broader participation from private and state sectors is needed to promote nuclear energy, Lal said while chairing a meeting of Consultative Committee of the Ministry of Power.\n\n\"(The) minister outlined the key challenges and strategic steps required for scaling up nuclear energy, including Amending the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 and Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010 to enable broader participation by private and state sectors and Strengthening public perception and enhancing awareness about nuclear energy's safety and benefits,\" the Power Ministry said in a statement.\n\nBesides, measures like introducing tax concessions, green power classification, and long-term financing to ensure competitive nuclear tariffs, and diversifying technology choices through competitive bidding and promoting indigenous manufacturing under Make in India are crucial nuclear energy, he said.\n\nLal said securing diversified uranium fuel sources and expanding the vendor base for specialised nuclear equipment and building skilled manpower capacity by strengthening nuclear education and training infrastructure are also important.\n\nFacilitating faster land acquisition through brownfield expansions and repurposing retired thermal sites and streamlining regulatory approval processes to reduce project timelines are also necessary for nuclear capacity addition, the minister said.\n\nA total of eight nuclear reactors having a capacity of 6,600 MW are in the underconstruction stage in the country, the statement said. Another 10 reactors with 7,000 MW capacity are in pre-project stages.\n\nIndia operates 25 nuclear reactors across seven locations, with a total installed capacity of 8,880 MW, contributing about 3 per cent of the country's electricity generation, it said.\n\nThe government targets 100 GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047 to strengthen India's long-term energy security.",

                            "body": "Pantoro Gold (ASX:PNR) released its Q3 FY2025 quarterly results presentation on April 29, 2025, revealing a mixed performance characterized by declining gold production but strengthening financial position. The company's shares fell 10.82% to A$2.72 on April 28, suggesting investors may have reacted negatively to some aspects of the results ahead of the formal presentation.\n\nThe gold producer, which recently changed its name from Pantoro Ltd following a shareholder vote on April 1, reported continued progress on its development projects despite operational challenges that impacted production volumes during the quarter.\n\nQuarterly Performance Highlights\n\nPantoro Gold reported production of 18,334 ounces for Q3 FY2025, down from 19,438 ounces in Q2 and 21,374 ounces in Q1. The company attributed the reduction to stoping ramp-up challenges and operator absences at key mining operations. Despite lower production, the company maintained strong financial performance with EBITDA of $46.4 million.\n\nAs shown in the following operational summary table, while underground mining volumes increased quarter-over-quarter, declining grades impacted overall production:\n\nThe company's All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC) rose slightly to $2,427 per ounce in Q3 from $2,356 per ounce in Q2, while C1 Cash Costs improved to $1,811 per ounce from $1,937 per ounce in the previous quarter. Major project capital expenditure decreased to $13.68 million from $19.18 million in Q2.\n\nDespite production challenges, Pantoro's cash position strengthened considerably during the quarter, as illustrated in this cash flow summary:\n\nThe company reported a cash and gold increase of $13.4 million, with 17,397 ounces of gold sold at an average price of A$4,540 per ounce. Significantly, Pantoro reduced its Nebari loan to US$6.26 million (A$9.8 million), strengthening its balance sheet position.\n\nOperational Updates\n\nThe Scotia underground mine showed continued progress in development and production ramp-up, with 1,817 meters of development achieved during the quarter. Production increased to 64,474 tonnes compared to 43,944 tonnes in the previous quarter, as shown in the following schematic:\n\nAt the OK Underground Mine, production reached 7,949 ounces during the quarter, slightly below plan due to operator absences in January and February. Exploration drilling returned promising results, indicating ore bodies remain open in all directions:\n\nOpen pit mining operations commenced at Princess Royal in March 2025, with 162,400 BCM excavated during the quarter. The company retained 774 tonnes of ore at 2.25 g/t, with waste stripping planned to continue. Approximately 1,800 ounces are planned for mining with steady ore supply expected.\n\nThe Bullen Decline rehabilitation progressed rapidly with 2,758 meters advanced by March 31, 2025. Permanent underground power has been established from the main power station, and initial drilling in the Esperanto Reef has commenced.\n\nStrategic Initiatives\n\nPantoro Gold implemented significant corporate changes during the quarter, with shareholders approving both a name change and share consolidation at a meeting on April 1, 2025. Shares and options/rights were consolidated at a ratio of 1:17, a move the company expects will reduce volatility and better reflect its market position.\n\nThe company reported that its current market valuation is higher than pre-consolidation, though the 10.82% share price drop on April 28 suggests investors may have concerns about operational performance.\n\nExploration activities continued across multiple sites, with drilling ongoing at underground mines and the Southern Mainfield. The company highlighted strong results from exploration drilling at Mainfield-Surface and initial drilling at Hinemoa (Polar Bear Peninsula).\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nLooking ahead to the June 2025 quarter, Pantoro provided the following guidance and outlook:\n\nThe company expects Scotia to reach full run rate, with approximately 35,000 tonnes at 4.1 g/t to be mined. The OK underground mine is anticipated to produce in steady-state with production expected to exceed 10,000 ounces.\n\nFor Q4 FY2025, Pantoro provided specific production guidance:\n\nThe company expects to produce between 23,000 to 26,000 ounces in Q4, which would place it at the lower end of its annual guidance range of 85,000-95,000 ounces. Pantoro noted that the site is currently operating at expected levels, having produced 7,968 ounces in March 2025 alone.\n\nPantoro emphasized its strong leverage to the gold price, with only 1,000 ounces per month capped at $4,200 per ounce for 2025 and no hedging beyond this year. With its strengthened balance sheet and ongoing growth activities, the company appears positioned to benefit from favorable gold prices despite the production challenges experienced in recent quarters.\n\nFull presentation:",

But he'd been gone from NASA for decades and was close to wrapping up his Senate career.\n\nEven a pair of 90-year-olds have flown to space, but only on 10-minute up-and-down hops by Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin rocket company.\n\nPettit, an engineer who still feels \"like a little kid inside,\" focused on his astrophotography while at the space station, capturing auroras, comets and satellites streaking off in the distance.\n\nHe also conducted a slew of physics experiments in his spare time, like blowing and stacking bubbles, and forming a perfect ball of honey on a spoon with peanut butter, in order to share the experience with others.\n\n\"I've got a few more good years left,\" Pettit said. \"I could see getting another flight or two in before I'm ready to hang up my rocket nozzles.\"",

                            "body": "6 min read\n\nJunoCam, the visible light imager aboard NASA's Juno, captured this enhanced-color view of Ju-piter's northern high latitudes from an altitude of about 36,000 miles (58,000 kilometers) above the giant planet's cloud tops during the spacecraft's 69th flyby on Jan. 28, 2025. Image data: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS Image processing: Jackie Branc (CC BY)\n\nNew data from the agency's Jovian orbiter sheds light on the fierce winds and cyclones of the gas giant's northern reaches and volcanic action on its fiery moon.\n\nNASA's Juno mission has gathered new findings after peering below Jupiter's cloud-covered atmosphere and the surface of its fiery moon, Io. Not only has the data helped develop a new model to better understand the fast-moving jet stream that encircles Jupiter's cyclone-festooned north pole, it's also revealed for the first time the subsurface temperature profile of Io, providing insights into the moon's inner structure and volcanic activity.\n\nTeam members presented the findings during a news briefing in Vienna on Tuesday, April 29, at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly.\n\n\"Everything about Jupiter is extreme. The planet is home to gigantic polar cyclones bigger than Australia, fierce jet streams, the most volcanic body in our solar system, the most powerful aurora, and the harshest radiation belts,\" said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of Juno at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"As Juno's orbit takes us to new regions of Jupiter's complex system, we're getting a closer look at the immensity of energy this gas giant wields.\"\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nMade with data from the JIRAM instrument aboard NASA's Juno, this animation shows the south polar region of Jupiter's moon Io during a Dec. 27, 2024, flyby. The bright spots are locations with higher temperatures caused by volcanic activity; the gray areas resulted when Io left the field of view. NASA/JPL/SwRI/ASI - JIRAM Team (A.M.) Lunar Radiator\n\nWhile Juno's microwave radiometer (MWR) was designed to peer beneath Jupiter's cloud tops, the team has also trained the instrument on Io, combining its data with Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) data for deeper insights.\n\n\"The Juno science team loves to combine very different datasets from very different instruments and see what we can learn,\" said Shannon Brown, a Juno scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"When we incorporated the MWR data with JIRAM's infrared imagery, we were surprised by what we saw: evidence of still-warm magma that hasn't yet solidified below Io's cooled crust. At every latitude and longitude, there were cooling lava flows.\"\n\nThe data suggests that about 10% of the moon's surface has these remnants of slowly cooling lava just below the surface. The result may help provide insight into how the moon renews its surface so quickly as well as how as well as how heat moves from its deep interior to the surface.\n\n\"Io's volcanos, lava fields, and subterranean lava flows act like a car radiator,\" said Brown, \"efficiently moving heat from the interior to the surface, cooling itself down in the vacuum of space.\"\n\nLooking at JIRAM data alone, the team also determined that the most energetic eruption in Io's history (first identified by the infrared imager during Juno's Dec. 27, 2024, Io flyby) was still spewing lava and ash as recently as March 2. Juno mission scientists believe it remains active today and expect more observations on May 6, when the solar-powered spacecraft flies by the fiery moon at a distance of about 55,300 miles (89,000 kilometers).\n\nThis composite image, derived from data collected in 2017 by the JIRAM instrument aboard NASA's Juno, shows the central cyclone at Jupiter's north pole and the eight cy-clones that encircle it. Data from the mission indicates these storms are enduring fea-tures.NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/ASI/INAF/JIRAM Colder Climes\n\nOn its 53rd orbit (Feb 18, 2023), Juno began radio occultation experiments to explore the gas giant's atmospheric temperature structure. With this technique, a radio signal is transmitted from Earth to Juno and back, passing through Jupiter's atmosphere on both legs of the journey. As the planet's atmospheric layers bend the radio waves, scientists can precisely measure the effects of this refraction to derive detailed information about the temperature and density of the atmosphere.\n\nSo far, Juno has completed 26 radio occultation soundings. Among the most compelling discoveries: the first-ever temperature measurement of Jupiter's north polar stratospheric cap reveals the region is about 11 degrees Celsius cooler than its surroundings and is encircled by winds exceeding 100 mph (161 kph).\n\nPolar Cyclones\n\nThe team's recent findings also focus on the cyclones that haunt Jupiter's north. Years of data from the JunoCam visible light imager and JIRAM have allowed Juno scientists to observe the long-term movement of Jupiter's massive northern polar cyclone and the eight cyclones that encircle it. Unlike hurricanes on Earth, which typically occur in isolation and at lower latitudes, Jupiter's are confined to the polar region.\n\nBy tracking the cyclones' movements across multiple orbits, the scientists observed that each storm gradually drifts toward the pole due to a process called \"beta drift\" (the interaction between the Coriolis force and the cyclone's circular wind pattern). This is similar to how hurricanes on our planet migrate, but Earthly cyclones break up before reaching the pole due to the lack of warm, moist air needed to fuel them, as well as the weakening of the Coriolis force near the poles. What's more, Jupiter's cyclones cluster together while approaching the pole, and their motion slows as they begin interacting with neighboring cyclones.\n\n\"These competing forces result in the cyclones 'bouncing' off one another in a manner reminiscent of springs in a mechanical system,\" said Yohai Kaspi, a Juno co-investigator from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. \"This interaction not only stabilizes the entire configuration, but also causes the cyclones to oscillate around their central positions, as they slowly drift westward, clockwise, around the pole.\"\n\nThe new atmospheric model helps explain the motion of cyclones not only on Jupiter, but potentially on other planets, including Earth.\n\n\"One of the great things about Juno is its orbit is ever-changing, which means we get a new vantage point each time as we perform a science flyby,\" said Bolton. \"In the extended mission, that means we're continuing to go where no spacecraft has gone before, including spending more time in the strongest planetary radiation belts in the solar system. It's a little scary, but we've built Juno like a tank and are learning more about this intense environment each time we go through it.\"\n\nMore About Juno\n\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, California, manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Scott Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. Juno is part of NASA's New Frontiers Program, which is managed at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for the agency's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The Italian Space Agency funded the Jovian InfraRed Auroral Mapper. Lockheed Martin Space in Denver built and operates the spacecraft. Various other institutions around the U.S. provided several of the other scientific instruments on Juno.\n\n/Public Release.

                            "body": "FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL -- During the Trump administration's first 100 days, NASA has made significant moves toward planting an American flag on Mars and getting a man back on the moon.\n\nIn his inaugural address, President Donald Trump said America \"will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.\"\n\nIn just a few months, NASA has expedited the return of American astronauts stranded in space; brought Panama and Bangladesh on as signatories of the Artemis Accords, which establish shared space exploration principles; and started the process of getting man to both Mars and the moon.\n\n\"Here at NASA, we're putting the America First agenda into play amongst the stars, ensuring the United States wins the space race at this critical juncture in time,\" NASA spokeswoman Bethany Stevens said.\n\nTeams began testing on the first of three 12-kW solar electric propulsion thrusters, which offer the necessary fuel economy and mission flexibility for long-duration missions to the moon and Mars.\n\nSolar electric propulsion, which uses electricity generated by solar panels to power electric thrusters, offers sustained cargo transport, orbital maneuvering, and transit operations necessary for a Mars landing.\n\nNASA completed its fourth \"entry, descent, and landing\" technology test in three months, accelerating innovation to achieve precision landings on Mars.\n\nNASA's Deep Space Optical Communications experiment enabled the high-bandwidth connections essential for communications with crewed missions to Mars.\n\nFirefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost Mission One successfully delivered 10 NASA payloads to the moon, advancing landing, autonomy, and data collection skills for the future Mars mission.\n\nA payload is a portion of a spacecraft or rocket that is responsible for achieving the mission's primary objectives.\n\nNASA's Moon to Mars Architecture Workshop gathered industry, academic, and international partners to refine exploration plans and identify collaboration opportunities.\n\nOn Dec. 11, 2017, Trump in his first term signed Space Policy Directive 1, which stated that \"the United States will lead the return of humans to the Moon for long-term exploration and utilization, followed by human missions to Mars and other destinations.\"\n\nIt has now been more than 52 years since an American has landed on the moon.\n\nTrump's second-term NASA has been preparing for Artemis II, the 2026 mission to the moon.\n\nTeams at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, have joined the core stage with the solid rocket boosters inside the Vehicle Assembly Building.\n\nThe core stage is the backbone of the rocket, supporting other components and carrying the payload.\n\nEngineers lifted the launch vehicle stage adapter atop the Space Launch System core stage, connecting key systems to power the lunar return.\n\nNASA attached the solar array wings that will help power the Orion spacecraft on its journey around the moon. Technicians also installed the protective fairings on Orion's service module to shield the spacecraft during the launch and ascent phase.\n\nNASA joined forces with the Department of Defense for Artemis II recovery training to make sure the U.S. is prepared to retrieve our astronauts after their historic mission around the moon.\n\nThe space agency unveiled the Artemis II mission patch, designating the mission as \"AII.\" That signifies the second major flight of the Artemis campaign, as well as an endeavor of discovery that seeks to explore for all and by all.\n\nNASA also finished stacking the twin solid rocket boosters for Artemis II. ·\n\n\"In just 100 days, under the bold leadership of President Trump and Acting Administrator Janet Petro, NASA has continued to further American innovation in space,\" Stevens, the NASA spokeswoman, said.",

The nation has 30 under construction, nearly half the global total, and is expected to leapfrog the US to become the world's largest atomic energy generator by the end of the decade.\n\nThe 10 latest reactors are expected to cost a total of 200 billion yuan ($27 billion), according to local media outlet, The Paper. Four were awarded to China General Nuclear Power Corp., to be deployed at its Fangchenggang and Taishan plants. China National Nuclear Corp., State Power Investment Corp. and China Huaneng Group Co. won approvals for two reactors each.\n\nSeveral Chinese nuclear stocks rose as trading opened on Monday, with CGN Power Co.'s Hong Kong-listed shares jumping 4.1%.\n\nChina's nuclear capacity is expected to reach 65 gigawatts by the end of 2025, according to the China Electricity Council, up from under 60 gigawatts last year. By 2040, the country's atomic fleet is expected to reach 200 gigawatts and account for about 10% of total power output, according to a report published on Sunday by the China Nuclear Energy Association.\n\nKey to executing that plan will be maintaining cost discipline. The $2.7 billion price tag for each of the 10 planned reactors stands in contrast to recent projects in the US and Europe beset by delays and overruns. In the UK, two reactors under construction at Hinkley Point C are expected to cost a combined &#163;47.9 billion ($63.7 billion).\n\nChina benefits from a state-run apparatus that gives project developers access to loans at low interest rates - a key savings given that most of a nuclear plant's lifetime cost is the upfront construction. A steady pipeline of projects means that supply chains can mature and construction crews can gain experience, reducing the chance of costly delays.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\n\nShow full article\n\nTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world\n\nFollow us:\n\nNuclear Power, Nuclear Reactors",

                            "title": "How high in demand are pilots?",
                            "body": "Pilot demand is exceptionally high globally, driven by a confluence of factors including airline expansion, an aging pilot workforce approaching retirement, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This shortage is not merely a future prediction; it's a current reality impacting flight operations, scheduling, and even the potential for future airline growth.\n\nThe aviation industry is grappling with a significant pilot shortage, projected to persist for several years. This isn't simply a cyclical issue; it's a deeply rooted problem stemming from various demographic and economic pressures. Airlines are actively competing for qualified pilots, offering increasingly attractive packages to attract and retain talent. The demand isn't limited to commercial airlines; it extends to cargo operators, business aviation, and even helicopter services. Understanding the root causes of this demand is crucial to grasping the overall landscape.\n\nSeveral factors have coalesced to create this perfect storm of pilot demand:\n\nVarious industry sources provide data on the projected pilot shortage. Boeing's Pilot and Technician Outlook, for example, consistently forecasts a significant demand for new pilots over the next two decades. Other organizations, such as CAE and Oliver Wyman, offer similar projections, painting a clear picture of the industry's need for qualified individuals.\n\nThe numbers are staggering: Over the next 20 years, hundreds of thousands of new pilots will be needed globally to meet the demands of a growing aviation sector. This translates into significant opportunities for aspiring pilots who are willing to invest in the necessary training and dedication.\n\nThe highest demand is currently for airline pilots, particularly those qualified to fly large commercial aircraft. However, there's also significant demand for regional airline pilots, corporate pilots, cargo pilots, and even helicopter pilots in specific sectors like offshore oil and gas or emergency medical services. The type of pilot license (e.g., Commercial Pilot License, Airline Transport Pilot License) directly influences the available opportunities.\n\nWhile the shortage is global, certain regions are experiencing more acute challenges. North America and Europe are facing significant shortages due to the aging pilot population and the rapid rebound in air travel. Asia-Pacific, particularly China and India, are experiencing rapid growth in air travel, creating immense demand for new pilots.\n\nThe pilot shortage is already affecting air travel in several ways. Flight cancellations and delays are becoming more frequent, particularly during peak seasons. Airlines are also reducing service to smaller communities due to a lack of pilots to operate those routes. Ultimately, the shortage can lead to increased ticket prices as airlines struggle to meet demand.\n\nAirlines are employing various strategies to attract and retain pilots, including:\n\nExperience is paramount. Airlines generally prefer pilots with substantial flight hours, particularly on turbine-powered aircraft. An Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) certificate, requiring a minimum number of flight hours, is essential for most commercial airline positions. Experience in specific aircraft types can also be highly advantageous.\n\nWhile a college degree is not always mandatory, it's increasingly preferred by major airlines. A degree in aviation-related fields, such as aeronautical science or aviation management, can be particularly beneficial. Regardless of the degree, aspiring pilots must complete flight training and obtain the necessary licenses and ratings from aviation authorities like the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) or EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency).\n\nThe cost of flight training can vary significantly depending on the type of training program and the location. Generally, obtaining a Commercial Pilot License (CPL) can cost between $60,000 and $100,000 or more. Obtaining an ATP certificate, which requires significantly more flight hours and training, adds to this cost.\n\nYes, various financial aid options are available, including:\n\nWhile automation is increasing in aircraft, it's unlikely to eliminate the need for pilots entirely. Pilots are still essential for managing complex situations, making critical decisions, and ensuring the safety of passengers and crew. Technology is more likely to augment the pilot's role, improving efficiency and safety rather than replacing them.\n\nThe long-term career prospects for pilots are excellent, given the projected pilot shortage. Pilots can expect competitive salaries, benefits, and opportunities for career advancement. However, the career requires dedication, continuous learning, and a commitment to safety.\n\nAbsolutely. Despite the challenges of the industry, the current high demand makes this an opportune time to pursue a career as a pilot. The demand is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future, offering excellent job security and earning potential for qualified individuals.\n\nNumerous resources are available to aspiring pilots, including:\n\nIn conclusion, the demand for pilots is demonstrably high and shows no signs of abating in the near future. This challenging landscape presents significant opportunities for those with the passion, dedication, and financial resources to pursue a career in aviation. With careful planning and diligent effort, aspiring pilots can embark on a rewarding and fulfilling career soaring through the skies.",
